However, collecting comprehensive research datasets often demands manually reviewing many web pages to identify and record relevant data points, which is labor-intensive and susceptible to error. While the emergence of large language models (LLM)-powered web agents has begun to automate parts of this process, they often struggle to ensure the validity of the data they collect. Indeed, these agents exhibit several recurring failure modes - including hallucinating or omitting values, misinterpreting page semantics, and failing to detect invalid information - which are subtle and difficult to detect and correct manually. To address this, we introduce the AI Committee, a novel model-agnostic multi-agent system that automates the process of validating and remediating web-sourced datasets. Each agent is specialized in a distinct task in the data quality assurance pipeline, from source scrutiny and fact-checking to data remediation and integrity validation. The AI Committee leverages various LLM capabilities - including in-context learning for dataset adaptation, chain-of-thought reasoning for complex semantic validation, and a self-correction loop for data remediation - all without task-specific training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by applying it to three real-world datasets, showing that it generalizes across LLMs and significantly outperforms baseline approaches, achieving data completeness up to 78.7% and precision up to 100%. We additionally conduct an ablation study demonstrating the contribution of each agent to the Committee's performance.

In structurally oriented expert data sets, this similarity rose to 0.85, indicating expert-level baseline comprehension. Qualitative analyses demonstrated that the multi-agent system, by integrating social-psychological perspectives and destigmatizing narratives, effectively corrected visual hallucinations and produced psychological reports with high ecological validity and internal coherence.\n  Conclusions: The findings confirm the potential of multimodal large models as standardized tools for projective assessment.

While existing frameworks like VideoScore-2 assess visual and semantic fidelity, they do not capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement. In this work, we propose a data-driven evaluation framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract unsupervised audiovisual features, clusters them into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator to predict engagement on short-form edutainment videos. Our curated YouTube Shorts dataset enables systematic analysis of how VLM-derived features relate to human engagement behavior. Experiments show strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement, demonstrating that our lightweight, feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments compared to traditional metrics (e.g., SSIM, FID). By grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals, our approach advances toward robust and explainable video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u89c2\u4f17\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u56de\u5f52\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u5728YouTube Shorts\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982VideoScore-2\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u8861\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u9a71\u52a8\u89c2\u4f17\u5b9e\u9645\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4ece\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u7c7b\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u5b50\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u6559\u80b2\u5a31\u4e50\u7c7b\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u89c2\u4f17\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u7684YouTube Shorts\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982SSIM\u3001FID\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0e\u4ee5\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

We examined the solutions derived by relevance-zone based solvers on seven L&D problems from the renowned book \"Life and Death Dictionary\" written by Cho Chikun, a Go grandmaster, and found several interesting results. First, for each problem, the solvers identify a relevance-zone that highlights the critical areas for solving. Second, the solvers discover a series of patterns, including some that are rare. Finally, the solvers even find different answers compared to the given solutions for two problems. We also identified two issues with the solver: (a) it misjudges values of rare patterns, and (b) it tends to prioritize living directly rather than maximizing territory, which differs from the behavior of human Go players. We suggest possible approaches to address these issues in future work.

The approaches dealing with complete information are well established in the literature, including the two complementary computational and conceptual formulations. The computational formulation uses equivalence relations, and the conceptual formulation uses satisfiability of logic formulas. In this paper, based on a briefly review of these two formulations, we generalize both formulations into three-way decision with incomplete information that is more practical in real-world applications. For the computational formulation, we propose a new measure of similarity degree of objects as a generalization of equivalence relations. Based on it, we discuss two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-similarity classes and approximability of objects, respectively. For the conceptual formulation, we propose a measure of satisfiability degree of formulas as a quantitative generalization of satisfiability with complete information. Based on it, we study two approaches to three-way decision using alpha-meaning sets of formulas and confidence of formulas, respectively.

Currently, reconstruction-based and unsupervised representation-based approaches are the primary focus. However, unsupervised representation-based methods struggle to extract robust features under domain shift, whereas reconstruction-based methods often suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection (CCAD). CCAD synergizes the strengths of both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for the reconstruction model. Furthermore, we design an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance both generalization and training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC while achieving faster convergence. In addition, we contribute a reorganized and re-annotated version of the DAGM 2007 dataset with new annotations to further validate our method's effectiveness.

Current methods for text-centric forgery analysis are often limited to coarse-grained visual analysis and lack the capacity for sophisticated reasoning. Moreover, they typically treat detection, grounding, and explanation as discrete sub-tasks, overlooking their intrinsic relationships for holistic performance enhancement. To address these challenges, we introduce LogicLens, a unified framework for Visual-Textual Co-reasoning that reformulates these objectives into a joint task. The deep reasoning of LogicLens is powered by our novel Cross-Cues-aware Chain of Thought (CCT) mechanism, which iteratively cross-validates visual cues against textual logic. To ensure robust alignment across all tasks, we further propose a weighted multi-task reward function for GRPO-based optimization. Complementing this framework, we first designed the PR$^2$ (Perceiver, Reasoner, Reviewer) pipeline, a hierarchical and iterative multi-agent system that generates high-quality, cognitively-aligned annotations. Then, we constructed RealText, a diverse dataset comprising 5,397 images with fine-grained annotations, including textual explanations, pixel-level segmentation, and authenticity labels for model training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LogicLens across multiple benchmarks. In a zero-shot evaluation on T-IC13, it surpasses the specialized framework by 41.4% and GPT-4o by 23.4% in macro-average F1 score. Moreover, on the challenging dense-text T-SROIE dataset, it establishes a significant lead over other MLLM-based methods in mF1, CSS, and the macro-average F1.

Dermoscopic skin lesion imaging allows human experts and AI systems to observe morphological structures otherwise not discernable from regular clinical photographs. However, currently there are no large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation (SLS) datasets with annotator-labels for dermoscopic skin lesion imaging. We introduce ISIC MultiAnnot++, a large public multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset for images from the ISIC Archive.

To address this challenge, we propose Leash (adaptive LEngth penAlty and reward SHaping), a reinforcement learning framework for efficient reasoning in LLMs. We formulate length control as a constrained optimization problem and employ a Lagrangian primal-dual method to dynamically adjust the penalty coefficient. When generations exceed the target length, the penalty is intensified; when they are shorter, it is relaxed. This adaptive mechanism guides models toward producing concise reasoning without sacrificing task performance. Experiments on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 show that Leash reduces the average reasoning length by 60% across diverse tasks - including in-distribution mathematical reasoning and out-of-distribution domains such as coding and instruction following - while maintaining competitive performance.

Existing fusion algorithms generally assume that, for every spatial location in the scene, there is at least one input image in which that location is in focus. Furthermore, current fusion models often suffer from edge artifacts caused by uncertain focus estimation or hard-selection operations in complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a generative multi-focus image fusion framework, termed GMFF, which operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, deterministic fusion is implemented using StackMFF V4, the latest version of the StackMFF series, and integrates the available focal plane information to produce an initial fused image. The second stage, generative restoration, is realized through IFControlNet, which leverages the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to reconstruct content from missing focal planes, restore fine details, and eliminate edge artifacts.

The system includes an input encoder for text and images, a projection module for cross-modal alignment, a reasoning controller that decomposes diagnostic tasks into steps, and a logic tree generator that assembles stepwise premises into verifiable conclusions.

Unlike humans, who effortlessly infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, and social norms from brief visual cues, current models tend to render literal scenes without capturing the underlying causal or psychological logic. To systematically evaluate this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation. Grounded in findings from developmental and social psychology, our benchmark organizes thirty classic social cognition paradigms into seven core dimensions, including mental-state inference, goal-directed action, joint attention, social coordination, prosocial behavior, social norms, and multi-agent strategy. To operationalize these paradigms, we develop a fully training-free agent-based pipeline that (i) distills the reasoning mechanism of each experiment, (ii) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (iii) enforces conceptual neutrality and difficulty control through cue-based critique, and (iv) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across five interpretable dimensions of social reasoning. Using this framework, we conduct the first large-scale study across seven state-of-the-art video generation systems.

We study parameter-efficient training (PET) strategies, including frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, and adapters for multi-label classification on the Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset (3,851 image-report pairs; 579 test samples). To mitigate data leakage, we redact pathology terms from reports used as text inputs while retaining clinical context. Under a fixed parameter budget (2.37M parameters, 2.51% of total), all PET variants achieve AUROC between 0.892 and 0.908, outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC), which uses 94.3M trainable parameters, a 40x reduction. External validation on CheXpert (224,316 images, 58x larger) confirms scalability: all PET methods achieve >0.69 AUROC with <9% trainable parameters, with Adapter achieving best performance (0.7214 AUROC). Budget-matched comparisons reveal that vision-only models (0.653 AUROC, 1.06M parameters) outperform budget-matched multimodal models (0.641 AUROC, 1.06M parameters), indicating improvements arise primarily from parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy. While PET methods show degraded calibration (ECE: 0.29-0.34) compared to simpler models (ECE: 0.049), this represents a tractable limitation addressable through post-hoc calibration methods. These findings demonstrate that frozen encoder strategies provide superior discrimination at substantially reduced computational cost, though calibration correction is essential for clinical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08PET\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6ce8\u610f\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728Indiana\u5927\u5b66\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u51bb\u7ed3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001BitFit\u3001LoRA\u548cAdapter\u7b49PET\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u672f\u8bed\u8fdb\u884c\u8131\u654f\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\uff1b\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6bd4\u8f83\u5404\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728CheXpert\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u540c\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709PET\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ec52.37M\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5360\u603b\u53c2\u65702.51%\uff09\u4e0b\u8fbe\u52300.892\u20130.908 AUROC\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u752894.3M\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\uff080.770 AUROC\uff09\uff1b\u5728CheXpert\u4e0a\uff0cAdapter\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff080.7214 AUROC\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709PET\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728<9%\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u5747\u8d85\u8fc70.69 AUROC\uff1b\u540c\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4f46PET\u65b9\u6cd5\u6821\u51c6\u8f83\u5dee\uff08ECE: 0.29\u20130.34 vs. 0.049\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51bb\u7ed3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6821\u51c6\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing methods optimize single metrics without addressing deployment-critical factors such as operating point selection and fixed-threshold robustness. This work addresses misleading robustness estimates by introducing a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol that holds decision thresholds, selected once on clean validation data, fixed across all post-processing transformations. Traditional methods retune thresholds per condition, artificially inflating robustness estimates and masking deployment failures. We report deployment-relevant performance at three operating points (Low-FPR, ROC-optimal, Best-F1) under systematic degradation testing using a lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid with gated fusion and optional frequency enhancement. Our evaluation exposes a statistically validated forensic-semantic spectrum: frequency-aided CNNs excel on pristine photos but collapse under compression (93.33% to 61.49%), whereas ViTs degrade minimally (92.86% to 88.36%) through robust semantic pattern recognition. Multi-seed experiments demonstrate that all architectures achieve 15% higher AUROC on artistic content (0.901-0.907) versus photorealistic images (0.747-0.759), confirming that semantic patterns provide fundamentally more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts. Our hybrid approach achieves balanced cross-domain performance: 91.4% accuracy on tiny-genimage photos, 89.7% on AiArtData art/graphics, and 98.3% (competitive) on CIFAKE. Fixed-threshold evaluation eliminates retuning inflation, reveals genuine robustness gaps, and yields actionable deployment guidance: prefer CNNs for clean photo verification, ViTs for compressed content, and hybrids for art/graphics screening.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u8861\u91cfAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u540e\u5904\u7406\uff08\u5982JPEG\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN-ViT\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6bd4\u4f9d\u8d56\u53d6\u8bc1\u4f2a\u5f71\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u79cd\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u6574\u51b3\u7b56\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u88ab\u4eba\u4e3a\u5938\u5927\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff1a\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u9009\u5b9a\u51b3\u7b56\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6240\u6709\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN-ViT\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u9009\u7684\u9891\u57df\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u70b9\uff08Low-FPR\u3001ROC\u6700\u4f18\u3001Best-F1\uff09\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9000\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u9891\u57df\u589e\u5f3a\u7684CNN\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u4f46\u5bf9\u538b\u7f29\u654f\u611f\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece93.33%\u964d\u81f361.49%\uff09\uff0c\u800cViT\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0892.86%\u219288.36%\uff09\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u827a\u672f\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0a\u7684AUROC\uff080.901\u20130.907\uff09\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u903c\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\uff080.747\u20130.759\uff09\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\uff08Tiny-GenImage\u7167\u724791.4%\uff0cAiArtData\u827a\u672f/\u56fe\u5f6289.7%\uff0cCIFAKE 98.3%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u91cd\u590d\u8c03\u9608\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u865a\u9ad8\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u771f\u5b9e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff1a\u5bf9\u5e72\u51c0\u7167\u7247\u4f7f\u7528CNN\uff0c\u5bf9\u538b\u7f29\u5185\u5bb9\u4f7f\u7528ViT\uff0c\u5bf9\u827a\u672f/\u56fe\u5f62\u5185\u5bb9\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Each arm has a stochastic number of capacities, and each unit of capacity is associated with a reward function. Each play is associated with a priority weight. When multiple plays compete for the arm capacity, the arm capacity is allocated in a larger priority weight first manner. Instance independent and instance dependent regret lower bounds of $\u03a9( \u03b1_1 \u03c3\\sqrt{KM T} )$ and $\u03a9(\u03b1_1 \u03c3^2 \\frac{M}\u0394 \\ln T)$ are proved, where $\u03b1_1$ is the largest priority weight and $\u03c3$ characterizes the reward tail. When model parameters are given, we design an algorithm named \\texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} to locate the optimal play allocation policy with a computational complexity of $O(MK^3)$.

Although data-driven polarization-based underwater 3D reconstruction methods show great potential, existing public datasets lack sufficient diversity in scattering and observation conditions, hindering fair comparisons among different approaches, including single-view and multi-view polarization imaging methods.\n  To address this limitation, we construct MuS-Polar3D, a benchmark dataset comprising polarization images of 42 objects captured under seven quantitatively controlled scattering conditions and five viewpoints, together with high-precision 3D models (+/- 0.05 mm accuracy), normal maps, and foreground masks. The dataset supports multiple vision tasks, including normal estimation, object segmentation, descattering, and 3D reconstruction.\n  Inspired by computational imaging, we further decouple underwater 3D reconstruction under scattering into a two-stage pipeline, namely descattering followed by 3D reconstruction, from an imaging-chain perspective. Extensive evaluations using multiple baseline methods under complex scattering conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark, achieving a best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees. To the best of our knowledge, MuS-Polar3D is the first publicly available benchmark dataset for quantitative turbidity underwater polarization-based 3D imaging, enabling accurate reconstruction and fair algorithm evaluation under controllable scattering conditions.

While these systems enable powerful new capabilities, increasing autonomy introduces critical challenges related to explainability, accountability, robustness, and governance, especially when agent outputs influence downstream actions or decisions. Existing agentic AI implementations often emphasize functionality and scalability, yet provide limited mechanisms for understanding decision rationale or enforcing responsibility across agent interactions. This paper presents a Responsible(RAI) and Explainable(XAI) AI Agent Architecture for production-grade agentic workflows based on multi-model consensus and reasoning-layer governance. In the proposed design, a consortium of heterogeneous LLM and VLM agents independently generates candidate outputs from a shared input context, explicitly exposing uncertainty, disagreement, and alternative interpretations. A dedicated reasoning agent then performs structured consolidation across these outputs, enforcing safety and policy constraints, mitigating hallucinations and bias, and producing auditable, evidence-backed decisions. Explainability is achieved through explicit cross-model comparison and preserved intermediate outputs, while responsibility is enforced through centralized reasoning-layer control and agent-level constraints. We evaluate the architecture across multiple real-world agentic AI workflows, demonstrating that consensus-driven reasoning improves robustness, transparency, and operational trust across diverse application domains.

However, in the later stages of training, the model tends to produce homogenized outputs, lacking creativity and visual diversity, which restricts its application scenarios. This issue can be analyzed from both reward modeling and generation dynamics perspectives. First, traditional GRPO relies on single-sample quality as the reward signal, driving the model to converge toward a few high-reward generation modes while neglecting distribution-level diversity. Second, conventional GRPO regularization neglects the dominant role of early-stage denoising in preserving diversity, causing a misaligned regularization budget that limits the achievable quality--diversity trade-off. Motivated by these insights, we revisit the diversity degradation problem from both reward modeling and generation dynamics. At the reward level, we propose a distributional creativity bonus based on semantic grouping. Specifically, we construct a distribution-level representation via spectral clustering over samples generated from the same caption, and adaptively allocate exploratory rewards according to group sizes to encourage the discovery of novel visual modes. At the generation level, we introduce a structure-aware regularization, which enforces stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency.

However, its quadratic complexity imposes a heavy computational burden in high-resolution scenarios, restricting the practical application. Previous methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing handcrafted patterns such as locality or sparsity, which inevitably compromise model capacity. In this paper, we present a novel attention paradigm termed \\textbf{Circulant Attention} by exploiting the inherent efficient pattern of self-attention. Specifically, we first identify that the self-attention matrix in vision Transformers often approximates the Block Circulant matrix with Circulant Blocks (BCCB), a kind of structured matrix whose multiplication with other matrices can be performed in $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ time. Leveraging this interesting pattern, we explicitly model the attention map as its nearest BCCB matrix and propose an efficient computation algorithm for fast calculation. The resulting approach closely mirrors vanilla self-attention, differing only in its use of BCCB matrices. Since our design is inspired by the inherent efficient paradigm, it not only delivers $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ computation complexity, but also largely maintains the capacity of standard self-attention. Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing circulant attention as a promising alternative to self-attention for vision Transformer architectures.

Recent dataset-free approaches that redirect self-attention inside the mask fail in two ways: non-target foregrounds are often misinterpreted as background, which regenerates unwanted objects, and direct attention manipulation disrupts fine details and hinders coherent integration of background cues. We propose EraseLoRA, a novel dataset-free framework that replaces attention surgery with background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation. First, Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE), uses a multimodal large-language models to separate target foreground, non-target foregrounds, and clean background from a single image-mask pair without paired supervision, producing reliable background cues while excluding distractors.

Through this process, we identify the root causes of the reproducibility dilemma in the field: firstly, papers often omit implicit details such as prepro cessing steps and parameter settings; secondly, most detec tion methods overfit to exclusive features of specific gener ators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images.

However, de tection performance drops sharply when preprocessing dis rupts key features or when testing across different genera tors.

We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer. Our work not only provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs but also offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLAid\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u589e\u5f3a\u5c0f\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6709\u6548\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u957f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u76843.2\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6807\u51c6VL\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u7a97\u53e3\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u6444\u5f71\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLAid\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1) \u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u52a0\u6743\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u5f3a\u8c03\u66f4\u957f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b(2) \u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684RoPE\u54cd\u5e94\u589e\u76ca\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u5173\u952e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLAid\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u957f\u5ea6\u53ef\u8fbe\u57fa\u7ebf\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u76843.2\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6807\u51c6VL\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7ef4\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6210\u529f\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f4e\u9891\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6210\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "LAid\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587VLM\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, existing methods for accurate, robust, and resource-efficient lesion analysis have limitations, including low performance and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose UltraLBM-UNet, a lightweight U-Net variant that integrates a bidirectional Mamba-based global modeling mechanism with multi-branch local feature perception. The proposed architecture integrates efficient local feature injection with bidirectional state-space modeling, enabling richer contextual interaction across spatial dimensions while maintaining computational compactness suitable for point-of-care deployment. Extensive experiments on the ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2 datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, outperforming existing lightweight and Mamba counterparts with only 0.034M parameters and 0.060 GFLOPs. In addition, we introduce a hybrid knowledge distillation strategy to train an ultra-compact student model, where the distilled variant UltraLBM-UNet-T, with only 0.011M parameters and 0.019 GFLOPs, achieves competitive segmentation performance.

An ideal personalized MLLM assistant is capable of engaging in long-context dialogues with humans and continually improving its experience quality by learning from past dialogue histories. To bridge this gap, we propose LCMP, the first Long-Context MLLM Personalization evaluation benchmark. LCMP assesses the capability of MLLMs in perceiving variations of personalized concepts and generating contextually appropriate personalized responses that reflect these variations. As a strong baseline for LCMP, we introduce a novel training-free and state-aware framework TAME. TAME endows MLLMs with double memories to manage the temporal and persistent variations of each personalized concept in a differentiated manner. In addition, TAME incorporates a new training-free Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation (RA2G) paradigm. RA2G introduces an alignment step to extract the contextually fitted information from the multi-memory retrieved knowledge to the current questions, enabling better interactions for complex real-world user queries.

Most existing methods aim to boost classification accuracy by enriching the extracted features with discriminative part-level details. However, they often overlook the fact that the set of support samples acts as a confounding variable, which hampers the FS-FGVC performance by introducing biased data distribution and misguiding the extraction of discriminative features. To address this issue, we propose a new causal FS-FGVC (CausalFSFG) approach inspired by causal inference for addressing biased data distributions through causal intervention. Specifically, based on the structural causal model (SCM), we argue that FS-FGVC infers the subcategories (i.e., effect) from the inputs (i.e., cause), whereas both the few-shot condition disturbance and the inherent fine-grained nature (i.e., large intra-class variance and small inter-class variance) lead to unobservable variables that bring spurious correlations, compromising the final classification performance. To further eliminate the spurious correlations, our CausalFSFG approach incorporates two key components: (1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) conducts sample-level interventions, (2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) conducts feature-level interventions, which together reveal real causalities from inputs to subcategories. Extensive experiments and thorough analyses on the widely-used public datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars, demonstrate that our CausalFSFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Bengali is the fifth most spoken language in the world. While several studies exist for languages such as English and Arabic, Bengali handwritten text generation has received little attention.

Furthermore, we leverage this restoration capability to enable a training-free harmonization mechanism, treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting to ensure seamless lighting and shadow consistency.

Bors"], "title": "Inference-based GAN Video Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "Video generation has seen remarkable progresses thanks to advancements in generative deep learning. Generated videos should not only display coherent and continuous movement but also meaningful movement in successions of scenes. Generating models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and more recently Diffusion Networks have been used for generating short video sequences, usually of up to 16 frames. In this paper, we first propose a new type of video generator by enabling adversarial-based unconditional video generators with a variational encoder, akin to a VAE-GAN hybrid structure, in order to enable the generation process with inference capabilities. The proposed model, as in other video deep learning-based processing frameworks, incorporates two processing branches, one for content and another for movement. However, existing models struggle with the temporal scaling of the generated videos. In classical approaches when aiming to increase the generated video length, the resulting video quality degrades, particularly when considering generating significantly long sequences. To overcome this limitation, our research study extends the initially proposed VAE-GAN video generation model by employing a novel, memory-efficient approach to generate long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames ensuring their temporal continuity, consistency and dynamics. Our approach leverages a Markov chain framework with a recall mechanism, with each state representing a VAE-GAN short-length video generator. This setup allows for the sequential connection of generated video sub-sequences, enabling temporal dependencies, resulting in meaningful long video sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408VAE\u4e0eGAN\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\uff08\u6570\u767e\u81f3\u6570\u5343\u5e27\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GAN\u3001VAE\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6700\u591a16\u5e27\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5728\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6269\u5c55\u89c6\u9891\u957f\u5ea6\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u878d\u5408\u53d8\u5206\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VAE-GAN\u6df7\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e00\u4e2a\u77ed\u5e8f\u5217VAE-GAN\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u6570\u767e\u751a\u81f3\u6570\u5343\u5e27\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u957f\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u8d28\u91cf\u9000\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408VAE-GAN\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks. Our work presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faInstructMoLE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982LoRA\uff09\u5728\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6613\u53d7\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u7684MoLE\u67b6\u6784\u56e0\u5c40\u90e8\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u5168\u5c40\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u51fa\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInstructMoLE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc\u8def\u7531\uff08IGR\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u5b8c\u6574\u6307\u4ee4\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u8def\u7531\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u4ee4\u724c\u7edf\u4e00\u9009\u62e9\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u529f\u80fd\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u8868\u5f81\u574d\u7f29\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cInstructMoLE\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548cMoLE\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "InstructMoLE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We establish a hierarchical definition system and construct large-scale datasets to evaluate perceptual-level image understanding. Based on this foundation, we develop a strong baseline UniPercept trained via Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training and Task-Aligned RL, enabling robust generalization across both Visual Rating (VR) and Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. UniPercept outperforms existing MLLMs on perceptual-level image understanding and can serve as a plug-and-play reward model for text-to-image generation.

Current unsupervised learning methods detect anomalies mainly through reconstructing abnormal images into pseudo-healthy images (PHIs) by normal samples learning and then analyzing differences between images. However, these unsupervised models face two significant limitations: restricted generalizability to multi-modality and multi-center MRIs due to their reliance on the specific imaging information in normal training data, and constrained performance due to abnormal residuals propagated from input images to reconstructed PHIs. To address these limitations, two novel modules are proposed, forming a new PHI reconstruction framework. Firstly, the disentangled representation module is proposed to improve generalizability by decoupling brain MRI into imaging information and essential imaging-invariant anatomical images, ensuring that the reconstruction focuses on the anatomy. Specifically, brain anatomical priors and a differentiable one-hot encoding operator are introduced to constrain the disentanglement results and enhance the disentanglement stability. Secondly, the edge-to-image restoration module is designed to reconstruct high-quality PHIs by restoring the anatomical representation from the high-frequency edge information of anatomical images, and then recoupling the disentangled imaging information. This module not only suppresses abnormal residuals in PHI by reducing abnormal pixels input through edge-only input, but also effectively reconstructs normal regions using the preserved structural details in the edges.

This work introduces SlideChain, a blockchain-backed provenance framework designed to provide verifiable integrity for multimodal semantic extraction at scale. Using the SlideChain Slides Dataset-a curated corpus of 1,117 medical imaging lecture slides from a university course-we extract concepts and relational triples from four state-of-the-art VLMs and construct structured provenance records for every slide. SlideChain anchors cryptographic hashes of these records on a local EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-compatible blockchain, providing tamper-evident auditability and persistent semantic baselines. Through the first systematic analysis of semantic disagreement, cross-model similarity, and lecture-level variability in multimodal educational content, we reveal pronounced cross-model discrepancies, including low concept overlap and near-zero agreement in relational triples on many slides. We further evaluate gas usage, throughput, and scalability under simulated deployment conditions, and demonstrate perfect tamper detection along with deterministic reproducibility across independent extraction runs. Together, these results show that SlideChain provides a practical and scalable step toward trustworthy, verifiable multimodal educational pipelines, supporting long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity for AI-assisted instructional systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSlideChain\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u7684\u6eaf\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6559\u5b66\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86SlideChain\u5728\u9632\u7be1\u6539\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89e3\u6790\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u8f93\u51fa\u96be\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u590d\u73b0\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u524a\u5f31\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u6559\u5b66\u6750\u6599\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u5b9a\u91cf\u7684STEM\u9886\u57df\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86SlideChain\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u672c\u5730\u517c\u5bb9EVM\uff08\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u865a\u62df\u673a\uff09\u7684\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u951a\u5b9a\u6bcf\u5f20\u6559\u5b66\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff09\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u54c8\u5e0c\u503c\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b1,117\u5f20\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u8bb2\u5ea7\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u56db\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbVLM\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6eaf\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0b\u7684Gas\u6d88\u8017\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53ca\u9632\u7be1\u6539\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540cVLM\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u4e0a\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e8e\u96f6\uff1bSlideChain\u5728\u591a\u6b21\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u7be1\u6539\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SlideChain\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6559\u80b2\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301AI\u8f85\u52a9\u6559\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002"}}

However, these explanations often reveal that the models do not align well with human domain knowledge, relying instead on spurious correlations. This might result in brittle behavior once deployed in the real-world. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient method for aligning small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge by leveraging the generalization capabilities of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Our LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method provides a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model. Our method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications, as validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that it effectively reduces the model's dependence on spurious features and on group-specific biases, without requiring fine-grained feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLVLM-VA\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLM\uff09\u5e2e\u52a9\u5c0f\u578b\u4e13\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53cc\u5411\u63a5\u53e3\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5c0f\u578b\u4e13\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u89e3\u91ca\u5e38\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLVLM-Aided Visual Alignment\uff08LVLM-VA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u5411\u63a5\u53e3\uff1a\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7\u89c4\u8303\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u6279\u8bc4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "conclusion": "LVLM-VA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c0f\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

To this end, we propose LongFly, a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for long-horizon UAV VLN. LongFly proposes a history-aware spatiotemporal modeling strategy that transforms fragmented and redundant historical data into structured, compact, and expressive representations. First, we propose the slot-based historical image compression module, which dynamically distills multi-view historical observations into fixed-length contextual representations. Then, the spatiotemporal trajectory encoding module is introduced to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial structure of UAV trajectories. Finally, to integrate existing spatiotemporal context with current observations, we design the prompt-guided multimodal integration module to support time-based reasoning and robust waypoint prediction.

Although diffusion-based human avatar generation methods achieve remarkable success, their non-causal architecture and high computational costs make them unsuitable for streaming.

To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage autoregressive adaptation and acceleration framework that applies autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement to adapt a high-fidelity human video diffusion model for real-time, interactive streaming. To ensure long-term stability and consistency, we introduce three key components: a Reference Sink, a Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) strategy, and a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Building on this framework, we develop a one-shot, interactive, human avatar model capable of generating both natural talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness.

Existing methods grapple with two primary limitations: i) Inflexible spatiotemporal representation due to reliance on positional encodings for capturing spatiotemporal information. ii) High computational costs stemming from the quadratic time complexity of conventional attention mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Spatiotemporal-Untrammelled Mixture of Experts (ST-MoE), which flexibly explores complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion and significantly reduces computational cost. To adaptively mine complex spatio-temporal patterns from human motion, our model incorporates four distinct types of spatiotemporal experts, each specializing in capturing different spatial or temporal dependencies. To reduce the potential computational overhead while integrating multiple experts, we introduce bidirectional spatiotemporal Mamba as experts, each sharing bidirectional temporal and spatial Mamba in distinct combinations to achieve model efficiency and parameter economy. Extensive experiments on four multi-person benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-art in accuracy but also reduces model parameter by 41.38% and achieves a 3.6x speedup in training.

This challenge is most acute for autonomous UAVs in dense urban environments, where foreseeing events from high-resolution imagery is non-negotiable for safety. Existing methods, reliant on iterative generation (diffusion, autoregressive models) or quadratic-complexity attention, fail to meet these stringent demands on edge hardware. To break this long-standing trade-off, we introduce RAPTOR, a video prediction architecture that achieves real-time, high-resolution performance. RAPTOR's single-pass design avoids the error accumulation and latency of iterative approaches. Its core innovation is Efficient Video Attention (EVA), a novel translator module that factorizes spatiotemporal modeling. Instead of processing flattened spacetime tokens with $O((ST)^2)$ or $O(ST)$ complexity, EVA alternates operations along the spatial (S) and temporal (T) axes. This factorization reduces the time complexity to $O(S + T)$ and memory complexity to $O(max(S, T))$, enabling global context modeling at $512^2$ resolution and beyond, operating directly on dense feature maps with a patch-free design.

We propose AstraNav-World, an end-to-end world model that jointly reasons about future visual states and action sequences within a unified probabilistic framework. Our framework integrates a diffusion-based video generator with a vision-language policy, enabling synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions are updated simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on those predicted visuals. This bidirectional constraint makes visual predictions executable and keeps decisions grounded in physically consistent, task-relevant futures, mitigating cumulative errors common in decoupled \"envision-then-plan\" pipelines. Experiments across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks show improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates. Ablations confirm the necessity of tight vision-action coupling and unified training, with either branch removal degrading both prediction quality and policy reliability. In real-world testing, AstraNav-World demonstrated exceptional zero-shot capabilities, adapting to previously unseen scenarios without any real-world fine-tuning. These results suggest that AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics, rather than merely overfitting to simulation-specific data distribution.

Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A \"running ahead\" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence.

Most existing methods rely on a mask-based training strategy, where the mouth region is masked in talking-head videos, and the model learns to synthesize lip movements from corrupted inputs and target audios. While this facilitates lip-sync accuracy, it disrupts spatiotemporal context, impairing performance on dynamic facial motions and causing instability in facial structure and background consistency. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncAnyone, a novel two-stage learning framework that achieves accurate motion modeling and high visual fidelity simultaneously. In Stage 1, we train a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting, leveraging its strong spatiotemporal modeling to generate accurate, audio-driven lip movements. However, due to input corruption, minor artifacts may arise in the surrounding facial regions and the background. In Stage 2, we develop a mask-free tuning pipeline to address mask-induced artifacts. Specifically, on the basis of the Stage 1 model, we develop a data generation pipeline that creates pseudo-paired training samples by synthesizing lip-synced videos from the source video and random sampled audio. We further tune the stage 2 model on this synthetic data, achieving precise lip editing and better background consistency.

Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBertsWin\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86BERT\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5168token\u63a9\u7801\u673a\u5236\u4e0eSwin Transformer\u7a97\u53e3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u53473D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6ViT-MAE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cBertsWin\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u6536\u655b\uff085.8\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u5408GradientConductor\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u51cf\u5c1115\u500d\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u9886\u5148\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eMasked Autoencoders\uff08MAE\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u57282D\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u74063D\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8btoken\u88ab\u4e22\u5f03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5b8c\u65743D\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faBertsWin\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u76843D token\u7f51\u683c\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u53ef\u89c1token\uff09\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5355\u5c42\u5c40\u90e8Swin\u7a97\u53e3\u964d\u4f4eViT\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5148\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684GradientConductor\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u989e\u4e0b\u988c\u5173\u8282\u9525\u5f62\u675fCT\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBertsWin\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6ViT-MAE\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53475.8\u500d\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408GradientConductor\u540e\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u4ece660\u964d\u81f344\uff08\u51cf\u5c1115\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5178\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u7a00\u758fViT\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684FLOPs\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "BertsWin\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u6301\u5b8c\u6574\u76843D\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing encoder-based methods are limited by visual-centric biases, classify each shot in isolation without leveraging sequential dependencies, and lack both narrative understanding and explainability. In this paper, we present Scene-VLM, the first fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) framework for video scene segmentation. Scene-VLM jointly processes visual and textual cues including frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata to enable multimodal reasoning across consecutive shots. The model generates predictions sequentially with causal dependencies among shots and introduces a context-focus window mechanism to ensure sufficient temporal context for each shot-level decision. In addition, we propose a scheme to extract confidence scores from the token-level logits of the VLM, enabling controllable precision-recall trade-offs that were previously limited to encoder-based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be aligned to generate coherent natural-language rationales for its boundary decisions through minimal targeted supervision.

It affects poor and rural communities and presents medical challenges and socioeconomic burdens on patients and healthcare systems in endemic regions worldwide. Mycetoma diagnosis is a major challenge in mycetoma management, particularly in low-resource settings where expert pathologists are limited. To address this challenge, this paper presents an overview of the Mycetoma MicroImage: Detect and Classify Challenge (mAIcetoma) which was organized to advance mycetoma diagnosis through AI solutions. mAIcetoma focused on developing automated models for segmenting mycetoma grains and classifying mycetoma types from histopathological images. The challenge attracted the attention of several teams worldwide to participate and five finalist teams fulfilled the challenge objectives. The teams proposed various deep learning architectures for the ultimate goal of this challenge.

We implement a likelihood-guided sampling procedure that combines an unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning to enforce measurement consistency for $4\\times$ super-resolution with additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate posterior sampling (PS) conditioning across guidance scales and noise levels, using PSNR and SSIM as fidelity metrics and a combined selection score $(\\mathrm{PSNR}/40)+\\mathrm{SSIM}$. Our ablation shows that moderate guidance improves reconstruction quality, with the best configuration achieved at PS scale $0.95$ and noise standard deviation $\u03c3=0.01$ (score $1.45231$). Qualitative results confirm that the selected PS setting restores sharper edges and more coherent facial details compared to the downsampled inputs, while alternative conditioning strategies (e.g., MCG and PS-annealed) exhibit different texture fidelity trade-offs.

Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEGA\uff08Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ea620%\u7684\u9ad8\u71b5\u5173\u952etoken\u65bd\u52a0\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u653b\u51fb\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7834\u574f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0835-49%\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dVLM\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u5f31\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u751f\u6210token\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8d21\u732e\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9ad8\u71b5token\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u5c11\u6570\u9ad8\u71b5token\u8fdb\u884c\u6270\u52a8\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6709\u5bb3\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793aVLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEGA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u96c6\u4e2d\u6270\u52a8VLM\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ea620%\u7684\u9ad8\u71b5\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\uff08\u5373\u9ad8\u71b5token\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5bf9\u6240\u6709token\u65bd\u52a0\u6270\u52a8\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u201c\u71b5\u5e93\u201d\u6307\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4ee5\u8f83\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "EGA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41VLM\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8693-95%\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c0635-49%\u7684\u826f\u6027\u8f93\u51fa\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9ad8\u71b5\u8106\u5f31\u70b9\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684VLM\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4ecd\u80fd\u8fbe\u523017-26%\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u751f\u6210\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "VLM\u5728\u9ad8\u71b5\u751f\u6210\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5b58\u5728\u666e\u904d\u4e14\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u653b\u51fb\u5373\u53ef\u4e25\u91cd\u7834\u574f\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5e76\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524dVLM\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u9632\u62a4\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

This paper proposes XET-V2X, a multi-modal fused end-to-end tracking framework for v2x collaboration that unifies multi-view multimodal sensing within a shared spatiotemporal representation. To efficiently align heterogeneous viewpoints and modalities, XET-V2X introduces a dual-layer spatial cross-attention module based on multi-scale deformable attention.

In practical applications, due to significant cross-modal disparities such as spatial misalignment, scale variations, and viewpoint shifts, the performance of current methods drastically deteriorates on unaligned datasets. To address this issue, we propose an efficient RGB-T SOD method for real-world unaligned image pairs, termed Thin-Plate Spline-driven Semantic Correlation Learning Network (TPS-SCL). We employ a dual-stream MobileViT as the encoder, combined with efficient Mamba scanning mechanisms, to effectively model correlations between the two modalities while maintaining low parameter counts and computational overhead. To suppress interference from redundant background information during alignment, we design a Semantic Correlation Constraint Module (SCCM) to hierarchically constrain salient features. Furthermore, we introduce a Thin-Plate Spline Alignment Module (TPSAM) to mitigate spatial discrepancies between modalities. Additionally, a Cross-Modal Correlation Module (CMCM) is incorporated to fully explore and integrate inter-modal dependencies, enhancing detection performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that TPS-SCL attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among existing lightweight SOD methods and outperforms mainstream RGB-T SOD approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTPS-SCL\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7RGB-T\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684RGB-T\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8584\u677f\u6837\u6761\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RGB-T\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684RGB-T\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6d41MobileViT\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u6548\u7684Mamba\u626b\u63cf\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u5757\uff08SCCM\uff09\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u8584\u677f\u6837\u6761\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\uff08TPSAM\uff09\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6a21\u5757\uff08CMCM\uff09\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTPS-SCL\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7SOD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41RGB-T SOD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TPS-SCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50RGB-T\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u7684\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Speculative decoding with draft trees accelerates LLMs yet underperforms on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty. We identify a key obstacle in applying speculative decoding to visual AR models: inconsistent acceptance rates across draft trees due to varying prediction difficulties in different image regions. We propose Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree), an adjacency-adaptive dynamic draft tree that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width by leveraging adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. ADT-Tree initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width via bisectional adaptation, yielding deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones. The empirical evaluations on MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompts demonstrate that ADT-Tree achieves speedups of 3.13xand 3.05x, respectively.

Although recent vision foundation models, such as CLIP, offer rich representations of images, they are not designed to focus on a specified condition. In this paper, we propose DIOR, a method that leverages a large vision-language model (LVLM) to generate conditional image embeddings. DIOR is a training-free approach that prompts the LVLM to describe an image with a single word related to a given condition. The hidden state vector of the LVLM's last token is then extracted as the conditional image embedding.

Our key insight is that, if a video inpainting model can be finetuned to remove the foreground-associated effects, then it must be inherently capable of perceiving these effects, and hence can also be finetuned for the complementary task: foreground layer decomposition with associated effects. However, although na\u00efvely finetuning the inpainting model with LoRA applied to all blocks can produce high-quality alpha mattes, it fails to capture associated effects. Our systematic analysis reveals this arises because effect-related cues are primarily encoded in specific DiT blocks and become suppressed when LoRA is applied across all blocks. To address this, we introduce EasyOmnimatte, the first unified, end-to-end video omnimatte method. Concretely, we finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model to learn dual complementary experts while keeping its original weights intact: an Effect Expert, where LoRA is applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture the coarse structure of the foreground and associated effects, and a fully LoRA-finetuned Quality Expert learns to refine the alpha matte. During sampling, Effect Expert is used for denoising at early, high-noise steps, while Quality Expert takes over at later, low-noise steps. This design eliminates the need for two full diffusion passes, significantly reducing computational cost without compromising output quality. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of this Dual-Expert strategy. Experiments demonstrate that EasyOmnimatte sets a new state-of-the-art for video omnimatte and enables various downstream tasks, significantly outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEasyOmnimatte\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5168\u906e\u7f69\uff08omnimatte\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u4fee\u590d\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\uff08Effect Expert\u548cQuality Expert\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u524d\u666f\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u8054\u6548\u679c\u7684\u7c97\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6alpha\u906e\u7f69\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5168\u906e\u7f69\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f13\u6162\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u89e3\u6548\u679c\u6b21\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5fae\u8c03\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u4fee\u590d\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1aEffect Expert\u4ec5\u5728\u5bf9\u6548\u679c\u654f\u611f\u7684DiT\u5757\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528LoRA\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u524d\u666f\u53ca\u5173\u8054\u6548\u679c\u7684\u7c97\u7565\u7ed3\u6784\uff1bQuality Expert\u5219\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5757\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316alpha\u906e\u7f69\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u91c7\u6837\u65e9\u671f\u4f7f\u7528Effect Expert\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5207\u6362\u81f3Quality Expert\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eEasyOmnimatte\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u5168\u906e\u7f69\u7684\u65b0SOTA\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "EasyOmnimatte\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u5168\u906e\u7f69\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present DPAR, a novel decoder-only autoregressive model that dynamically aggregates image tokens into a variable number of patches for efficient image generation. Our work is the first to demonstrate that next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight and unsupervised autoregressive model provides a reliable criterion for merging tokens into larger patches based on information content. DPAR makes minimal modifications to the standard decoder architecture, ensuring compatibility with multimodal generation frameworks and allocating more compute to generation of high-information image regions. Further, we demonstrate that training with dynamically sized patches yields representations that are robust to patch boundaries, allowing DPAR to scale to larger patch sizes at inference. DPAR reduces token count by 1.81x and 2.06x on Imagenet 256 and 384 generation resolution respectively, leading to a reduction of up to 40% FLOPs in training costs.

Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSLIM-Brain\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u65e0\u56fe\u8c31fMRI\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea64\u5343\u6b21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u8bdd\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd530%\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dfMRI\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u964d\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f46\u4e22\u5931\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u4e14\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u65e0\u56fe\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u8282\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "SLIM-Brain\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67b6\u6784\uff1a(i) \u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u5bf9\u5168\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u6309\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u7a97\u53e3\uff1b(ii) 4D\u5206\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08Hiera-JEPA\uff09\u4ec5\u4ecetop-k\u7a97\u53e3\u5b66\u4e60\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5220\u9664\u7ea670%\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSLIM-Brain\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea64,000\u6b21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u8bdd\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ea630%\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "conclusion": "SLIM-Brain\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86fMRI\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u8111\u6210\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We validated CrownGen through a quantitative benchmark on 496 external scans and a clinical study of 26 restoration cases. Results demonstrate that CrownGen surpasses state-of-the-art models in geometric fidelity and significantly reduces active design time. Clinical assessments by trained dentists confirmed that CrownGen-assisted crowns are statistically non-inferior in quality to those produced by expert technicians using manual workflows.

While existing methods can generate temporally consistent results for short or regular motions, significant challenges remain, particularly in generating long-duration videos. Furthermore, the synthesis of fine-grained facial and hand details remains under-explored, limiting the applicability of current approaches in real-world, high-quality applications. To address these limitations, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based framework which focuses on generating high-fidelity and long-duration human animation videos. First, we design a set of hybrid implicit guidance signals and a sharpness guidance factor, enabling our framework to additionally incorporate detailed facial and hand features as guidance. Next, we incorporate the time-aware position shift fusion module, modify the input format within the DiT backbone, and refer to this mechanism as the Position Shift Adaptive Module, which enables video generation of arbitrary length. Finally, we introduce a novel data augmentation strategy and a skeleton alignment model to reduce the impact of human shape variations across different identities.

However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements.

For such an underexplored enhancement task, we first curate images from various sources and construct an unpaired anime scenery dataset with diverse environments and illumination conditions to address the data scarcity. To exploit the power of uncertainty information inherent with the diverse illumination conditions, we propose a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, motivated by the idea from Relativistic GAN. By analogy with the wave-particle duality of light, our framework interpretably defines and quantifies the illumination uncertainty of dark/bright samples, which is leveraged to dynamically adjust the objective functions to recalibrate the model learning under data uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRU framework by training several versions of EnlightenGANs, yielding superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond the state-of-the-art methods that are incapable of learning from data uncertainty perspective. We hope our framework can expose a novel paradigm of data-centric learning for potential visual and language domains.

The idea is to take all pairwise normalized differences from the spectral bands and then build polynomial combinations up to a fixed degree, which gives a structured search space that still keeps the illumination invariance needed in remote sensing. For a sensor with $n$ bands this produces $\\binom{n}{2}$ base normalized differences, and the degree-2 polynomial expansion gives 1,080 candidate features for the 10-band Sentinel-2 configuration we use here. Feature selection methods (ANOVA filtering, recursive elimination, and $L_1$-regularized SVM) then pick out small sets of indices that reach the desired accuracy, so the final models stay simple and easy to interpret. We test the framework on Kochia (\\textit{Bassia scoparia}) detection using Sentinel-2 imagery from Saskatchewan, Canada ($N = 2{,}318$ samples, 2022--2024). A single degree-2 index, the product of two normalized differences from the red-edge bands, already reaches 96.26\\% accuracy, and using eight indices only raises this to 97.70\\%. In every case the chosen features are degree-2 products built from bands $b_4$ through $b_8$, which suggests that the discriminative signal comes from spectral \\emph{interactions} rather than individual band ratios.

An Adversarial Parametric Editing Framework for Hallucination Mitigation in VLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the AI community due to their promising practical applications, they exhibit persistent hallucination issues, generating outputs misaligned with visual inputs. Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \\textbf{A}ctivate-\\textbf{L}ocate-\\textbf{E}dit \\textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations.

However, building agents that are both efficient for high-level tasks and precise for fine-grained interactions remains challenging. GUI agents must perform routine actions efficiently while also handling tasks that demand exact visual grounding, yet existing approaches struggle when accuracy depends on identifying specific interface elements. These MLLMs also remain large and cannot adapt their reasoning depth to the task at hand. In this work, we introduce iSHIFT: Implicit Slow-fast Hybrid Inference with Flexible Tokens, a lightweight agent that integrates latent thinking (implicit chain-of-thought) with a perception control module. iSHIFT enables an MLLM to switch between a slow mode, which leverages detailed visual grounding for high precision and a fast mode that uses global cues for efficiency.

Surprisingly, we find that directly transferring classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) to VSFMs is almost ineffective, with ASR below 5\\%. To understand this, we study encoder gradients and attention maps and observe that conventional training keeps gradients for clean and triggered samples largely aligned, while attention still focuses on the true object, preventing the encoder from learning a distinct trigger-related representation. To address this challenge, we propose BadVSFM, the first backdoor framework tailored to prompt-driven VSFMs. BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a designated target embedding while clean frames remain aligned with a clean reference encoder; (2) train the mask decoder so that, across prompt types, triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder. Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show that BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Ablations over losses, stages, targets, trigger settings, and poisoning rates demonstrate robustness to reasonable hyperparameter changes and confirm the necessity of the two-stage design. Finally, gradient-conflict analysis and attention visualizations show that BadVSFM separates triggered and clean representations and shifts attention to trigger regions, while four representative defenses remain largely ineffective, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBadVSFM\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982SAM2\uff09\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u690d\u5165\u540e\u95e8\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VSFMs\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9762\u4e34\u540e\u95e8\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u7ecf\u5178\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5982BadNet\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3VSFMs\u65f6\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u6548\uff08ASR<5%\uff09\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0b\u89e6\u53d1\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u68af\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e14\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ecd\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u76f8\u5173\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBadVSFM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\uff1a(1) \u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f7f\u89e6\u53d1\u5e27\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6307\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u800c\u5e72\u51c0\u5e27\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5e72\u51c0\u53c2\u8003\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b(2) \u8bad\u7ec3\u63a9\u7801\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5404\u7c7b\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u5e27-\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e72\u51c0\u8f93\u51fa\u63a5\u8fd1\u53c2\u8003\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e94\u79cdVSFM\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBadVSFM\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5206\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff1b\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5206\u79bb\u89e6\u53d1\u4e0e\u5e72\u51c0\u8868\u5f81\u5e76\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5411\u89e6\u53d1\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u56db\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5176\u57fa\u672c\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "BadVSFM\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u63d0\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u6bb5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u3002"}}

Motivated by this vision, we present MAI-UI, a family of foundation GUI agents spanning the full spectrum of sizes, including 2B, 8B, 32B, and 235B-A22B variants. We identify four key challenges to realistic deployment: the lack of native agent-user interaction, the limits of UI-only operation, the absence of a practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic environments. MAI-UI addresses these issues with a unified methodology: a self-evolving data pipeline that expands the navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, a native device-cloud collaboration system routes execution by task state, and an online RL framework with advanced optimizations to scale parallel environments and context length. MAI-UI establishes new state-of-the-art across GUI grounding and mobile navigation. On grounding benchmarks, it reaches 73.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G, and 49.2% on UI-Vision, surpassing Gemini-3-Pro and Seed1.8 on ScreenSpot-Pro. On mobile GUI navigation, it sets a new SOTA of 76.7% on AndroidWorld, surpassing UI-Tars-2, Gemini-2.5-Pro and Seed1.8. On MobileWorld, MAI-UI obtains 41.7% success rate, significantly outperforming end-to-end GUI models and competitive with Gemini-3-Pro based agentic frameworks. Our online RL experiments show significant gains from scaling parallel environments from 32 to 512 (+5.2 points) and increasing environment step budget from 15 to 50 (+4.3 points). Finally, the native device-cloud collaboration system improves on-device performance by 33%, reduces cloud model calls by over 40%, and preserves user privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MAI-UI\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u89c4\u6a21\uff082B\u81f3235B-A22B\uff09\u7684\u901a\u7528GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u7aef\u4e91\u534f\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u5927\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aGUI\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u5bfc\u822a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dGUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u751f\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56UI\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5bfc\u822a\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u5305\u542b\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u548cMCP\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff1b2\uff09\u539f\u751f\u7aef\u4e91\u534f\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u72b6\u6001\u8def\u7531\u6267\u884c\uff1b3\uff09\u5e26\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e76\u884c\u73af\u5883\u548c\u66f4\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728GUI\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cMAI-UI\u5728ScreenSpot-Pro\uff0873.5%\uff09\u3001MMBench GUI L2\uff0891.3%\uff09\u3001OSWorld-G\uff0870.9%\uff09\u548cUI-Vision\uff0849.2%\uff09\u4e0a\u5237\u65b0SOTA\uff1b\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728AndroidWorld\u8fbe\u523076.7%\uff0cMobileWorld\u8fbe41.7%\u3002\u5728\u7ebfRL\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u73af\u5883\u4ece32\u6269\u81f3512\u63d0\u53475.2\u5206\uff0c\u73af\u5883\u6b65\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u4ece15\u589e\u81f350\u63d0\u53474.3\u5206\uff1b\u7aef\u4e91\u534f\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u7aef\u4fa7\u6027\u80fd33%\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e91\u7aef\u8c03\u7528\u8d8540%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "conclusion": "MAI-UI\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes.

Project page: https://isee-laboratory.github.io/ProEdit/ Code: https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/ProEdit", "summary": "Inversion-based visual editing provides an effective and training-free way to edit an image or a video based on user instructions. Existing methods typically inject source image information during the sampling process to maintain editing consistency. However, this sampling strategy overly relies on source information, which negatively affects the edits in the target image (e.g., failing to change the subject's atributes like pose, number, or color as instructed). In this work, we propose ProEdit to address this issue both in the attention and the latent aspects. In the attention aspect, we introduce KV-mix, which mixes KV features of the source and the target in the edited region, mitigating the influence of the source image on the editing region while maintaining background consistency. In the latent aspect, we propose Latents-Shift, which perturbs the edited region of the source latent, eliminating the influence of the inverted latent on the sampling. Extensive experiments on several image and video editing benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance. In addition, our design is plug-and-play, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing inversion and editing methods, such as RF-Solver, FireFlow and UniEdit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faProEdit\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7KV-mix\u548cLatents-Shift\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u9762\u51cf\u5c11\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u6f14\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u6f14\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6309\u7167\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u4fee\u6539\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u59ff\u6001\u3001\u6570\u91cf\u6216\u989c\u8272\uff09\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProEdit\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u9762\u5f15\u5165KV-mix\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u7684KV\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u51cf\u5f31\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u9762\u63d0\u51faLatents-Shift\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u6e90\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u53cd\u6f14\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\uff08SOTA\uff09\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u53cd\u6f14\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff08\u5982RF-Solver\u3001FireFlow\u548cUniEdit\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "ProEdit\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f16\u8f91\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), which transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals that shape perception during training. BiPS first applies a KL-consistency constraint between the original image and an evidence-preserving view that keeps only question-relevant regions, encouraging coarse but complete coverage of supporting pixels. It then applies a KL-separation constraint between the original and an evidence-ablated view where critical pixels are masked so the image no longer supports the original answer, discouraging text-only shortcuts (i.e., answering from text alone) and enforcing fine-grained visual reliance. Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u5851\u9020\uff08BiPS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u95ee\u9898\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u89c6\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u53cc\u5411\u201c\u5173\u6ce8\u533a\u57df\u201d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u5229\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347Qwen2.5-VL-7B\u6a21\u578b8.2%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u501f\u52a9\u4e2d\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5ffd\u7565\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u3001\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "BiPS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ea6\u675f\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u4fdd\u7559\u89c6\u56fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u65bd\u52a0KL\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u652f\u6301\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u50cf\u7d20\u88ab\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6d88\u878d\u89c6\u56fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u65bd\u52a0KL\u5206\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u4f5c\u7b54\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cBiPS\u4f7fQwen2.5-VL-7B\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53478.2%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "BiPS\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
