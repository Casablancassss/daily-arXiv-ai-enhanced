### [1] [Leveraging Text Guidance for Enhancing Demographic Fairness in Gender Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11015)
*Anoop Krishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出利用图像标题中的语义信息，通过图文匹配引导和图文融合两种策略，在无需人口统计标签的情况下提升面部图像性别分类算法的公平性与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于面部图像的性别分类算法存在显著的人口统计偏见，亟需在不依赖敏感人口标签的前提下提升模型的公平性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出两种文本引导方法：1）图像-文本匹配（ITM）引导，训练模型捕捉图像与文本间的细粒度对齐关系；2）图像-文本融合，将两种模态信息整合为更全面的表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，所提方法能有效缓解性别和种族群体间的偏差，提升分类准确率，并增强模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 引入文本语义指导是一种有效且通用的策略，可在无显式人口标签条件下提升面部性别分类系统的公平性，为构建更公正的视觉算法提供新思路。

Abstract: In the quest for fairness in artificial intelligence, novel approaches to enhance it in facial image based gender classification algorithms using text guided methodologies are presented. The core methodology involves leveraging semantic information from image captions during model training to improve generalization capabilities. Two key strategies are presented: Image Text Matching (ITM) guidance and Image Text fusion. ITM guidance trains the model to discern fine grained alignments between images and texts to obtain enhanced multimodal representations. Image text fusion combines both modalities into comprehensive representations for improved fairness. Exensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate these approaches effectively mitigate bias and improve accuracy across gender racial groups compared to existing methods. Additionally, the unique integration of textual guidance underscores an interpretable and intuitive training paradigm for computer vision systems. By scrutinizing the extent to which semantic information reduces disparities, this research offers valuable insights into cultivating more equitable facial analysis algorithms. The proposed methodologies contribute to addressing the pivotal challenge of demographic bias in gender classification from facial images. Furthermore, this technique operates in the absence of demographic labels and is application agnostic.

Abstract: Soccer understanding has recently garnered growing research interest due to its domain-specific complexity and unique challenges. Unlike prior works that typically rely on isolated, task-specific expert models, this work aims to propose a unified model to handle diverse soccer visual understanding tasks, ranging from fine-grained perception (e.g., athlete detection) to semantic reasoning (e.g., event classification). Specifically, our contributions are threefold: (i) we present SoccerMaster, the first soccer-specific vision foundation model that unifies diverse understanding tasks within a single framework via supervised multi-task pretraining; (ii) we develop an automated data curation pipeline to generate scalable spatial annotations, and integrate them with various existing soccer video datasets to construct SoccerFactory, a comprehensive pretraining data resource; and (iii) we conduct extensive evaluations demonstrating that SoccerMaster consistently outperforms task-specific expert models across diverse downstream tasks, highlighting its breadth and superiority. The data, code, and model will be publicly available.

### [3] [Weakly Supervised Tuberculosis Localization in Chest X-rays through Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11057)
*Marshal Ashif Shawkat,Moidul Hasan,Taufiq Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究利用知识蒸馏技术训练CNN模型，在无需边界框标注的情况下减少虚假关联并定位结核病相关异常，在TBX11k数据集上取得了0.2428的mIOU分数，且学生模型表现优于教师模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结核病（TB）是全球主要致死原因之一，尤其在资源有限地区。胸部X光（CXR）虽为经济有效的诊断工具，但依赖专家解读，而专家常不可得。现有机器学习模型易受虚假关联影响，泛化能力差，且高质量医学图像标注成本高昂。

Method: 采用基于ResNet50架构的教师-学生知识蒸馏框架，在TBX11k数据集上训练CNN模型，以减少虚假关联并在无边界框标注条件下定位TB异常区域。

Result: 所提方法在TBX11k数据集上达到0.2428的mIOU分数，且学生模型在实验中始终优于教师模型，显示出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了模型对TB异常的定位能力和泛化性能，具备在多样化临床环境中部署的潜力。

Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, particularly in resource-limited countries. Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging serves as an accessible and cost-effective diagnostic tool but requires expert interpretation, which is often unavailable. Although machine learning models have shown high performance in TB classification, they often depend on spurious correlations and fail to generalize. Besides, building large datasets featuring high-quality annotations for medical images demands substantial resources and input from domain specialists, and typically involves several annotators reaching agreement, which results in enormous financial and logistical expenses. This study repurposes knowledge distillation technique to train CNN models reducing spurious correlations and localize TB-related abnormalities without requiring bounding-box annotations. By leveraging a teacher-student framework with ResNet50 architecture, the proposed method trained on TBX11k dataset achieve impressive 0.2428 mIOU score. Experimental results further reveal that the student model consistently outperforms the teacher, underscoring improved robustness and potential for broader clinical deployment in diverse settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Synthetic Vasculature Reasoning（SVR）的框架，通过可控合成视网膜血管图像及其对应的细粒度病理描述文本，构建了包含10万对样本的OCTA-100K-SVR数据集，用于训练视觉语言模型（VLM），在真实OCTA图像上实现了89.67%的零样本平衡分类准确率，并显著提升了临床解释质量和病灶定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学领域中，特别是在光学相干断层扫描血管成像（OCTA）等专业模态下，缺乏大规模、带有精准病理描述的图像-文本配对数据，限制了可解释视觉语言模型的发展。为解决这一数据稀缺瓶颈，作者提出合成数据的方法。

Method: 提出SVR框架，可控地合成具有糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）特征（如毛细血管无灌注、微动脉瘤、新生血管和血管迂曲）的真实感视网膜血管图像，并自动生成细粒度推理文本，构建OCTA-100K-SVR数据集；利用该数据集训练通用VLM（Qwen3-VL-8b）。

Result: 在真实OCTA图像上，训练后的VLM实现89.67%的零样本平衡分类准确率，优于有监督基线；人类专家评估表明其在临床数据上的解释质量和病灶定位能力显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过可控合成高质量图像-文本对，SVR框架有效缓解了医学视觉语言模型训练中的数据稀缺问题，显著提升了模型在真实临床场景中的诊断准确性与可解释性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path toward interpretable medical diagnosis by allowing users to ask about clinical explanations alongside predictions and across different modalities. However, training VLMs for detailed reasoning requires large-scale image-text datasets. In many specialized domains, for example in reading Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images, such precise text with grounded description of pathologies is scarce or even non-existent. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce Synthetic Vasculature Reasoning (SVR), a framework that controllably synthesizes images and corresponding text, specifically: realistic retinal vasculature with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) features: capillary dropout, microaneurysms, neovascularization, and tortuosity, while automatically generating granular reasoning texts. Based on this we curate OCTA-100K-SVR, an OCTA image-reasoning dataset with 100,000 pairs. Our experiments show that a general-purpose VLM (Qwen3-VL-8b) trained on the dataset achieves a zero-shot balanced classification accuracy of 89.67% on real OCTA images, outperforming supervised baselines. Through human expert evaluation we also demonstrate that it significantly enhances explanation quality and pathology localization on clinical data.

### [5] [E-CHUM: Event-based Cameras for Human Detection and Urban Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11076)
*Jack Brady,Andrew Dailey,Kristen Schang,Zo Vic Shong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文综述了城市动态研究方法的演进，重点探讨了基于事件的相机在该领域的潜力，分析其优势、挑战及与机器学习的结合，并提出多传感器融合策略以提升城市动态监测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统城市监测方法存在局限，而新兴技术如事件相机具备独特优势，有望更高效、隐私友好地捕捉城市动态信息。

Method: 通过综述事件相机的工作原理、应用场景、优缺点及其在机器学习中的应用，并探讨其与红外、事件LiDAR或振动传感器等多模态融合的可能性。

Result: 事件相机因其低光适应性、高时间分辨率和隐私保护特性，适用于城市动态研究；多传感器融合可弥补其固有缺陷并增强整体感知能力。

Conclusion: 事件相机是一种有前景的城市动态监测工具，结合多传感器融合策略可进一步推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Understanding human movement and city dynamics has always been challenging. From traditional methods of manually observing the city's inhabitant, to using cameras, to now using sensors and more complex technology, the field of urban monitoring has evolved greatly. Still, there are more that can be done to unlock better practices for understanding city dynamics. This paper surveys how the landscape of urban dynamics studying has evolved with a particular focus on event-based cameras. Event-based cameras capture changes in light intensity instead of the RGB values that traditional cameras do. They offer unique abilities, like the ability to work in low-light, that can make them advantageous compared to other sensors. Through an analysis of event-based cameras, their applications, their advantages and challenges, and machine learning applications, we propose event-based cameras as a medium for capturing information to study urban dynamics. They offer the ability to capture important information while maintaining privacy. We also suggest multi-sensor fusion of event-based cameras and other sensors in the study of urban dynamics. Combining event-based cameras and infrared, event-LiDAR, or vibration has to potential to enhance the ability of event-based cameras and overcome the challenges that event-based cameras have.

### [6] [Vision-Language Models for Infrared Industrial Sensing in Additive Manufacturing Scene Description](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11098)
*Nazanin Mahjourian,Vinh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出VLM-IRIS框架，通过将红外图像预处理为RGB兼容格式并结合CLIP模型，在无需重新训练的情况下实现红外图像的零样本工件检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉系统在低光或封闭制造环境中表现不佳，而红外相机具有优势；但现有视觉-语言模型（VLMs）仅适用于RGB图像，无法直接用于红外数据。同时，监督学习需要大量标注数据，限制了其在工业红外场景中的应用，因此亟需一种适用于红外图像的零样本学习方法。

Method: 作者提出VLM-IRIS框架，将FLIR Boson传感器捕获的红外图像转换为magma色彩映射的RGB兼容表示，并结合CLIP ViT-B/32编码器与质心提示集成（centroid prompt ensembling）策略，实现对红外图像的零样本推理。

Result: 在3D打印平台上的工件存在性检测任务中，VLM-IRIS在未进行任何模型再训练的情况下实现了高准确率，验证了该方法在热成像工业监测中的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过适当的图像预处理和提示工程，现有基于RGB的视觉-语言模型可有效迁移至红外领域，为无标签工业热成像监测提供了一种实用的零样本解决方案。

Abstract: Many manufacturing environments operate in low-light conditions or within enclosed machines where conventional vision systems struggle. Infrared cameras provide complementary advantages in such environments. Simultaneously, supervised AI systems require large labeled datasets, which makes zero-shot learning frameworks more practical for applications including infrared cameras. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) offer a new path in zero-shot predictions from paired image-text representations. However, current VLMs cannot understand infrared camera data since they are trained on RGB data. This work introduces VLM-IRIS (Vision-Language Models for InfraRed Industrial Sensing), a zero-shot framework that adapts VLMs to infrared data by preprocessing infrared images captured by a FLIR Boson sensor into RGB-compatible inputs suitable for CLIP-based encoders. We demonstrate zero-shot workpiece presence detection on a 3D printer bed where temperature differences between the build plate and workpieces make the task well-suited for thermal imaging. VLM-IRIS converts the infrared images to magma representation and applies centroid prompt ensembling with a CLIP ViT-B/32 encoder to achieve high accuracy on infrared images without any model retraining. These findings demonstrate that the proposed improvements to VLMs can be effectively extended to thermal applications for label-free monitoring.

### [7] [VGent: Visual Grounding via Modular Design for Disentangling Reasoning and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11099)
*Weitai Kang,Jason Kuen,Mengwei Ren,Zijun Wei,Yan Yan,Kangning Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出VGent，一种模块化编码器-解码器架构，通过将高层推理与低层边界框预测解耦，在多目标视觉定位任务中实现更快、更准确的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位模型要么依赖自回归解码的多模态大语言模型（速度慢且易产生幻觉），要么通过重新对齐视觉特征学习新标记（可能损害预训练语言模型的推理能力）。

Method: 采用冻结的多模态大语言模型作为编码器保留其强大推理能力，解码器则利用高质量检测器生成的候选框作为查询，通过交叉注意力机制从编码器隐藏状态中选择目标框；同时引入QuadThinker强化学习训练策略、掩码感知标签和全局目标识别机制以增强整体性能。

Result: 在多目标视觉定位基准上，VGent相较先前方法F1提升20.6%，在视觉参考挑战下gIoU提升8.2%、cIoU提升5.8%，并保持恒定且快速的推理延迟。

Conclusion: VGent通过模块化解耦设计有效结合了目标检测与多模态大语言模型的优势，在保证推理速度的同时显著提升了视觉定位精度。

Abstract: Current visual grounding models are either based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that performs auto-regressive decoding, which is slow and risks hallucinations, or on re-aligning an LLM with vision features to learn new special or object tokens for grounding, which may undermine the LLM's pretrained reasoning ability. In contrast, we propose VGent, a modular encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly disentangles high-level reasoning and low-level bounding box prediction. Specifically, a frozen MLLM serves as the encoder to provide untouched powerful reasoning capabilities, while a decoder takes high-quality boxes proposed by detectors as queries and selects target box(es) via cross-attending on encoder's hidden states. This design fully leverages advances in both object detection and MLLM, avoids the pitfalls of auto-regressive decoding, and enables fast inference. Moreover, it supports modular upgrades of both the encoder and decoder to benefit the whole system: we introduce (i) QuadThinker, an RL-based training paradigm for enhancing multi-target reasoning ability of the encoder; (ii) mask-aware label for resolving detection-segmentation ambiguity; and (iii) global target recognition to improve the recognition of all the targets which benefits the selection among augmented proposals. Experiments on multi-target visual grounding benchmarks show that VGent achieves a new state-of-the-art with +20.6% F1 improvement over prior methods, and further boosts gIoU by +8.2% and cIoU by +5.8% under visual reference challenges, while maintaining constant, fast inference latency.

### [8] [Information-driven Fusion of Pathology Foundation Models for Enhanced Disease Characterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11104)
*Brennan Flannery,Thomas DeSilvio,Jane Nguyen,Satish E. Viswanath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于信息驱动的智能融合策略，整合多个病理基础模型（FMs），在肾癌、前列腺癌和直肠癌的分级/分期任务中显著优于单一模型或简单融合方法，同时提升了模型性能与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基础模型（FMs）在病理任务中表现优异，但对其嵌入空间的互补性、冗余性及生物学意义的理解仍有限，亟需有效整合多模型以提升下游任务效果。

Method: 研究采用三种融合策略（多数投票集成、朴素特征拼接、基于相关性引导的冗余特征剪枝的智能融合），在tile级和slide级分别整合多个病理FMs，并在三类癌症的H&E全切片图像上训练分类器，通过患者分层交叉验证评估性能。

Result: 智能融合在所有三类癌症中均优于最佳单一FM和朴素融合；全局相似性高但局部邻域一致性低，表明FM间存在细粒度互补信息；注意力图显示智能融合更聚焦肿瘤区域，减少对良性区域的误关注。

Conclusion: 基于相关性引导的智能融合能生成紧凑且任务定制的表示，在提升计算病理任务预测性能的同时增强模型可解释性。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse pathology tasks. While there are similarities in the pre-training objectives of FMs, there is still limited understanding of their complementarity, redundancy in embedding spaces, or biological interpretation of features. In this study, we propose an information-driven, intelligent fusion strategy for integrating multiple pathology FMs into a unified representation and systematically evaluate its performance for cancer grading and staging across three distinct diseases. Diagnostic H&E whole-slide images from kidney (519 slides), prostate (490 slides), and rectal (200 slides) cancers were dichotomized into low versus high grade or stage. Both tile-level FMs (Conch v1.5, MUSK, Virchow2, H-Optimus1, Prov-Gigapath) and slide-level FMs (TITAN, CHIEF, MADELEINE) were considered to train downstream classifiers. We then evaluated three FM fusion schemes at both tile and slide levels: majority-vote ensembling, naive feature concatenation, and intelligent fusion based on correlation-guided pruning of redundant features. Under patient-stratified cross-validation with hold-out testing, intelligent fusion of tile-level embeddings yielded consistent gains in classification performance across all three cancers compared with the best single FMs and naive fusion. Global similarity metrics revealed substantial alignment of FM embedding spaces, contrasted by lower local neighborhood agreement, indicating complementary fine-grained information across FMs. Attention maps showed that intelligent fusion yielded concentrated attention on tumor regions while reducing spurious focus on benign regions. Our findings suggest that intelligent, correlation-guided fusion of pathology FMs can yield compact, task-tailored representations that enhance both predictive performance and interpretability in downstream computational pathology tasks.

### [9] [Learning from a Generative Oracle: Domain Adaptation for Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11121)
*Yuyang Hu,Mojtaba Sahraee-Ardakan,Arpit Bansal,Kangfu Mei,Christian Qi,Peyman Milanfar,Mauricio Delbracio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEGO is a three-stage post-training domain adaptation framework that improves pre-trained image restoration models on real-world, out-of-distribution data without paired ground truth or architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained image restoration models struggle with real-world degradations due to domain gaps, and existing adaptation methods are limited by the lack of ground truth and the need for complex model modifications.

Method: LEGO converts unsupervised domain adaptation into pseudo-supervised learning by (1) generating initial restorations using the pre-trained model, (2) refining them into high-quality pseudo-ground-truths via a frozen generative oracle, and (3) fine-tuning the model with mixed supervision from in-distribution data and pseudo-pairs.

Result: Experiments show LEGO significantly enhances performance on diverse real-world benchmarks while preserving the model’s original robustness.

Conclusion: LEGO effectively bridges the domain gap in image restoration tasks, offering a practical and architecture-agnostic solution for adapting models to unseen real-world degradations.

Abstract: Pre-trained image restoration models often fail on real-world, out-of-distribution degradations due to significant domain gaps. Adapting to these unseen domains is challenging, as out-of-distribution data lacks ground truth, and traditional adaptation methods often require complex architectural changes. We propose LEGO (Learning from a Generative Oracle), a practical three-stage framework for post-training domain adaptation without paired data. LEGO converts this unsupervised challenge into a tractable pseudo-supervised one. First, we obtain initial restorations from the pre-trained model. Second, we leverage a frozen, large-scale generative oracle to refine these estimates into high-quality pseudo-ground-truths. Third, we fine-tune the original model using a mixed-supervision strategy combining in-distribution data with these new pseudo-pairs. This approach adapts the model to the new distribution without sacrificing its original robustness or requiring architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO effectively bridges the domain gap, significantly improving performance on diverse real-world benchmarks.

### [10] [Learning complete and explainable visual representations from itemized text supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11141)
*Yiwei Lyu,Chenhui Zhao,Soumyanil Banerjee,Shixuan Liu,Akshay Rao,Akhil Kondepudi,Honglak Lee,Todd C. Hollon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出ItemizedCLIP框架，用于从条目化文本监督（如医学影像和遥感图像中的多个独立描述）中学习完整且可解释的视觉表示，显著提升了零样本性能和细粒度可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言监督方法多依赖冗余或高度重叠的多标题标注，而许多视觉领域（如医学影像、遥感）采用的是条目化文本注释——即单张图像包含多个语义独立的文本项。现有方法难以有效利用此类监督信号，因此需要新框架来建模这种特殊形式的图文对齐。

Method: ItemizedCLIP引入交叉注意力模块生成与文本条目条件相关的视觉嵌入，并设计了专门的目标函数，联合优化“条目独立性”（不同条目对应不同图像区域）和“表示完整性”（覆盖所有文本条目）。

Result: 在四个具有天然条目化文本监督的领域（脑部MRI、头颅CT、胸部CT、遥感）及一个合成数据集上，ItemizedCLIP在零样本性能和细粒度可解释性方面均显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ItemizedCLIP能够从条目化文本监督中学习到语义明确、条目可区分、完整且视觉可解释的表示，为非物体中心视觉领域的多模态表征学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Training vision models with language supervision enables general and transferable representations. However, many visual domains, especially non-object-centric domains such as medical imaging and remote sensing, contain itemized text annotations: multiple text items describing distinct and semantically independent findings within a single image. Such supervision differs from standard multi-caption supervision, where captions are redundant or highly overlapping. Here, we introduce ItemizedCLIP, a framework for learning complete and explainable visual representations from itemized text supervision. ItemizedCLIP employs a cross-attention module to produce text item-conditioned visual embeddings and a set of tailored objectives that jointly enforce item independence (distinct regions for distinct items) and representation completeness (coverage of all items). Across four domains with naturally itemized text supervision (brain MRI, head CT, chest CT, remote sensing) and one additional synthetically itemized dataset, ItemizedCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot performance and fine-grained interpretability over baselines. The resulting ItemizedCLIP representations are semantically grounded, item-differentiable, complete, and visually interpretable. Our code is available at https://github.com/MLNeurosurg/ItemizedCLIP.

### [11] [Image Tiling for High-Resolution Reasoning: Balancing Local Detail with Global Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11167)
*Anatole Jacquin de Margerie,Alexis Roger,Irina Rish*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文复现并分析了Monkey视觉语言模型（VLM），验证了其通过图像分块恢复细节的有效性，并进一步探讨了全局上下文的作用，同时指出结果在不同任务和分块粒度下存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂多模态模型常缺乏透明的实现细节和可访问的训练基础设施，影响科学可复现性。为验证并深入理解Monkey VLM提出的高分辨率图像理解方法，作者开展复现与扩展研究。

Method: 基于公开的检查点复现Monkey VLM的图像分块策略，并重新实现其训练流程；在此基础上，进一步引入全局上下文进行对比实验，分析不同任务类型和分块粒度对性能的影响。

Result: 成功复现了原论文的核心发现，即图像分块能有效恢复局部细节；同时发现加入全局上下文可提供实用见解，但复现结果与原文存在一定偏差，且偏差程度依赖于任务类型和分块粒度。

Conclusion: Monkey VLM的图像分块策略在高分辨率多模态建模中具有有效性，但其性能受任务和分块设置影响显著；未来工作应更全面地考虑全局与局部信息的融合方式，并提升方法的可复现性。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a cornerstone of scientific progress, yet complex multimodal models often lack transparent implementation details and accessible training infrastructure. In this work, we present a detailed reproduction and critical analysis of the Monkey Vision-Language Model (VLM) (Li et al. 2023b) published in CVPR24, a recent approach to high-resolution image understanding via image tiling. The original paper proposed splitting large images into tiles to recover fine-grained visual details while maintaining computational efficiency. Our study replicates this strategy using open checkpoints and reimplements the training pipeline. We confirm the key finding of the original Monkey VLM work, namely that tiling effectively recovers local details. We then extend this work further, by investigating the effect of the inclusion of the global context, which provide practical insights for future high-resolution multimodal modeling. However, we also report deviations in the results, with the magnitude of these effects depending heavily on task type and tile granularity.

### [12] [Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression via Video Codec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11186)
*Qi Yang,Geert Van Der Auwera,Zhu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视频编解码器的轻量级3D高斯泼溅（GS）压缩方法（LGSCV），通过两阶段Morton扫描生成适合标准视频编码器的分块2D图，并结合SH的PCA降维与快速灵活的MiniPLAS排序策略，在中低码率下显著提升率失真性能，同时大幅降低2D图生成和编码时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于PLAS的GS压缩方法计算开销大、耗时长，难以在轻量设备上部署，亟需一种高效且兼容标准视频编解码器的轻量压缩方案。

Method: 提出两阶段Morton扫描（先3D后2D）生成分块2D图；引入PCA对球谐系数进行降维；设计轻量、灵活的MiniPLAS用于块内GS图元排序，并指导视频编码器CU尺寸配置。

Result: 在MPEG数据集上，LGSCV相比SOTA方法获得超过20%的率失真增益，2D图生成时间降至约1秒，编码时间减少50%。

Conclusion: 所提出的LGSCV方法在保证压缩效率的同时显著降低计算复杂度，有效推动了3D GS在资源受限设备上的实际应用。

Abstract: Current video-based GS compression methods rely on using Parallel Linear Assignment Sorting (PLAS) to convert 3D GS into smooth 2D maps, which are computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting the application of GS on lightweight devices. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) Compression method based on Video codec (LGSCV). First, a two-stage Morton scan is proposed to generate blockwise 2D maps that are friendly for canonical video codecs in which the coding units (CU) are square blocks. A 3D Morton scan is used to permute GS primitives, followed by a 2D Morton scan to map the ordered GS primitives to 2D maps in a blockwise style. However, although the blockwise 2D maps report close performance to the PLAS map in high-bitrate regions, they show a quality collapse at medium-to-low bitrates. Therefore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of spherical harmonics (SH), and a MiniPLAS, which is flexible and fast, is designed to permute the primitives within certain block sizes. Incorporating SH PCA and MiniPLAS leads to a significant gain in rate-distortion (RD) performance, especially at medium and low bitrates. MiniPLAS can also guide the setting of the codec CU size configuration and significantly reduce encoding time. Experimental results on the MPEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed LGSCV achieves over 20% RD gain compared with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing 2D map generation time to approximately 1 second and cutting encoding time by 50%. The code is available at https://github.com/Qi-Yangsjtu/LGSCV .

TL;DR: 本文提出CADKnitter，一种基于几何引导扩散采样的组合式CAD生成框架，能根据给定CAD模型和文本提示生成符合几何与语义约束的互补部件，并构建了包含31万样本的KnitCAD数据集。


<details>

Motivation: 现有单部件CAD生成方法难以满足真实应用场景中多部件在语义和几何约束下的装配需求，亟需一种能同时兼顾功能性和可编辑性的组合式CAD生成方法。

Method: 提出CADKnitter框架，采用几何引导的扩散采样策略，结合文本提示与已有CAD模型的几何信息，生成满足双重约束的新CAD部件；同时构建包含文本提示和装配元数据的KnitCAD数据集以支持训练与评估。

Conclusion: CADKnitter有效解决了多部件CAD模型在语义与几何约束下的组合生成问题，为功能性、可编辑的智能CAD设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Crafting computer-aided design (CAD) models has long been a painstaking and time-intensive task, demanding both precision and expertise from designers. With the emergence of 3D generation, this task has undergone a transformative impact, shifting not only from visual fidelity to functional utility but also enabling editable CAD designs. Prior works have achieved early success in single-part CAD generation, which is not well-suited for real-world applications, as multiple parts need to be assembled under semantic and geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose CADKnitter, a compositional CAD generation framework with a geometry-guided diffusion sampling strategy. CADKnitter is able to generate a complementary CAD part that follows both the geometric constraints of the given CAD model and the semantic constraints of the desired design text prompt. We also curate a dataset, so-called KnitCAD, containing over 310,000 samples of CAD models, along with textual prompts and assembly metadata that provide semantic and geometric constraints. Intensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin.

*Zhengyang Yu,Akio Hayakawa,Masato Ishii,Qingtao Yu,Takashi Shibuya,Jing Zhang,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出AutoRefiner，一种专为自回归视频扩散模型（AR-VDMs）设计的噪声优化模块，通过路径感知噪声精炼和反射式KV缓存机制，在不更新模型参数的前提下高效提升生成样本保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AR-VDMs在样本保真度方面仍有不足，而现有基于推理时对齐的噪声优化方法（如用于文本到图像模型的前馈噪声精炼器）无法直接有效应用于AR-VDMs。

Method: 提出AutoRefiner，包含两个关键设计：路径感知噪声精炼（pathwise noise refinement）和反射式KV缓存（reflective KV-cache），以单次前向传播方式对AR-VDMs中的噪声进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，AutoRefiner可作为AR-VDMs的高效即插即用模块，显著提升生成视频的样本保真度。

Conclusion: AutoRefiner成功将前馈噪声精炼技术适配至AR-VDMs，解决了直接迁移T2I噪声精炼器失败的问题，为提升AR-VDMs生成质量提供了一种高效可行的方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models (AR-VDMs) show strong promise as scalable alternatives to bidirectional VDMs, enabling real-time and interactive applications. Yet there remains room for improvement in their sample fidelity. A promising solution is inference-time alignment, which optimizes the noise space to improve sample fidelity without updating model parameters. Yet, optimization- or search-based methods are computationally impractical for AR-VDMs. Recent text-to-image (T2I) works address this via feedforward noise refiners that modulate sampled noises in a single forward pass. Can such noise refiners be extended to AR-VDMs? We identify the failure of naively extending T2I noise refiners to AR-VDMs and propose AutoRefiner-a noise refiner tailored for AR-VDMs, with two key designs: pathwise noise refinement and a reflective KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate that AutoRefiner serves as an efficient plug-in for AR-VDMs, effectively enhancing sample fidelity by refining noise along stochastic denoising paths.

### [15] [SmokeBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models for Wildfire Smoke Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11215)
*Tianye Qi,Weihao Li,Nick Barnes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为SmokeBench的基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在图像中识别和定位野火烟雾的能力。研究发现，尽管部分模型能识别大面积烟雾，但在早期阶段的精确定位方面普遍存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野火烟雾具有透明、无定形且常与云混淆的特性，使得早期检测极具挑战性。现有MLLM在该任务上的能力尚不明确，因此需要一个专门的基准来系统评估其性能。

Method: 构建包含四个任务的SmokeBench基准：烟雾分类、基于图块的烟雾定位、基于网格的烟雾定位和烟雾检测，并在多个主流MLLM上进行评估。

Result: 实验表明，当烟雾覆盖面积较大时，部分模型可有效分类；但所有模型在精确定位（尤其是早期阶段）方面表现不佳。进一步分析显示，模型性能与烟雾体积强相关，而与对比度关系较小。

Conclusion: 当前MLLM在安全关键的野火监测任务中存在显著局限，亟需开发能提升早期烟雾定位能力的新方法。

Abstract: Wildfire smoke is transparent, amorphous, and often visually confounded with clouds, making early-stage detection particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce a benchmark, called SmokeBench, to evaluate the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to recognize and localize wildfire smoke in images. The benchmark consists of four tasks: (1) smoke classification, (2) tile-based smoke localization, (3) grid-based smoke localization, and (4) smoke detection. We evaluate several MLLMs, including Idefics2, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3, Unified-IO 2, Grounding DINO, GPT-4o, and Gemini-2.5 Pro. Our results show that while some models can classify the presence of smoke when it covers a large area, all models struggle with accurate localization, especially in the early stages. Further analysis reveals that smoke volume is strongly correlated with model performance, whereas contrast plays a comparatively minor role. These findings highlight critical limitations of current MLLMs for safety-critical wildfire monitoring and underscore the need for methods that improve early-stage smoke localization.

### [16] [VFMF: World Modeling by Forecasting Vision Foundation Model Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11225)
*Gabrijel Boduljak,Yushi Lan,Christian Rupprecht,Andrea Vedaldi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种在视觉基础模型（VFM）特征空间中进行自回归流匹配的生成式预测方法，通过将VFM特征编码到紧凑潜在空间中，实现对多模态未来状态（如语义分割、深度、法线甚至RGB图像）的高效、准确且具有不确定性的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于像素的视频生成方法计算开销大且难以直接用于决策；而基于VFM特征的确定性回归虽高效但无法捕捉未来不确定性，导致预测精度受限。因此需要一种既能保留VFM特征优势又能建模多模态未来的方法。

Method: 作者提出在VFM特征空间中进行自回归流匹配的生成式预测框架，关键在于将VFM特征编码进一个比PCA更有效的紧凑潜在空间，以支持扩散模型进行生成，并可解码为多种可解释的输出模态。

Result: 在相同架构和计算资源下，该方法在所有输出模态上均优于确定性回归，生成更清晰、更准确的预测结果，并在图像生成等任务中也表现出更强的信息保留能力。

Conclusion: 在VFM特征空间中进行随机条件生成是一种有前景且可扩展的世界建模基础方法，能兼顾效率、准确性与不确定性建模。

Abstract: Forecasting from partial observations is central to world modeling. Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce a generative forecaster that performs autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space. Our key insight is that generative modeling in this space requires encoding VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion. We show that this latent space preserves information more effectively than previously used PCA-based alternatives, both for forecasting and other applications, such as image generation. Our latent predictions can be easily decoded into multiple useful and interpretable output modalities: semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, and even RGB. With matched architecture and compute, our method produces sharper and more accurate predictions than regression across all modalities. Our results suggest that stochastic conditional generation of VFM features offers a promising and scalable foundation for future world models.

*Hongbin Lin,Yiming Yang,Yifan Zhang,Chaoda Zheng,Jie Feng,Sheng Wang,Zhennan Wang,Shijia Chen,Boyang Wang,Yu Zhang,Xianming Liu,Shuguang Cui,Zhen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FutureX，一种基于思维链（CoT）的端到端自动驾驶规划框架，通过引入潜在世界模型对未来场景进行推理，并结合自适应“思考”机制，在复杂交通环境中生成更合理、安全的轨迹，同时保持高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端规划器仅依赖当前场景信息，在高度动态的交通环境中可能因无法预测自身行为对环境的后续影响而产生次优决策。为解决这一问题，需建模未来场景的演化过程以支持更复杂的推理。

Method: FutureX采用CoT驱动的两阶段机制：首先由Auto-think Switch判断当前场景是否需要深入推理；若需要，则进入Thinking模式，利用Latent World Model进行CoT引导的未来场景表示预测，并由Summarizer Module优化轨迹；否则在Instant模式下直接输出规划结果。

Result: 实验表明FutureX在不牺牲效率的前提下显著提升规划性能，例如在NAVSIM上使TransFuser的PDMS指标提升6.2，同时减少碰撞并生成更合理的运动规划。

Conclusion: FutureX通过融合思维链与潜在世界模型，有效增强了端到端规划器在动态环境中的推理能力与安全性，为复杂自动驾驶场景提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end planners learn scene representations from raw sensor data and utilize them to generate a motion plan or control actions. However, exclusive reliance on the current scene for motion planning may result in suboptimal responses in highly dynamic traffic environments where ego actions further alter the future scene. To model the evolution of future scenes, we leverage the World Model to represent how the ego vehicle and its environment interact and change over time, which entails complex reasoning. The Chain of Thought (CoT) offers a promising solution by forecasting a sequence of future thoughts that subsequently guide trajectory refinement. In this paper, we propose FutureX, a CoT-driven pipeline that enhances end-to-end planners to perform complex motion planning via future scene latent reasoning and trajectory refinement. Specifically, the Auto-think Switch examines the current scene and decides whether additional reasoning is required to yield a higher-quality motion plan. Once FutureX enters the Thinking mode, the Latent World Model conducts a CoT-guided rollout to predict future scene representation, enabling the Summarizer Module to further refine the motion plan. Otherwise, FutureX operates in an Instant mode to generate motion plans in a forward pass for relatively simple scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FutureX enhances existing methods by producing more rational motion plans and fewer collisions without compromising efficiency, thereby achieving substantial overall performance gains, e.g., 6.2 PDMS improvement for TransFuser on NAVSIM. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了REST，首个基于扩散模型的实时端到端流式音频驱动说话人头像生成框架，通过高时空压缩的VAE、ID-Context Cache机制和异步流式蒸馏策略，在保证生成质量的同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的说话人头像生成方法因推理速度慢和非自回归范式限制了其在实时场景中的应用。

Method: 提出REST框架：1）利用高时空VAE压缩构建紧凑视频潜在空间；2）引入ID-Context Cache机制（结合ID-Sink与Context-Cache）实现潜在空间中的自回归流式生成；3）设计异步流式蒸馏（ASD）训练策略，利用非流式教师模型指导流式学生模型训练以减少误差累积。

Result: 实验表明REST在生成速度和整体性能上均优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: REST成功弥合了自回归与扩散模型之间的差距，在实时说话人头像生成任务中展现出重要应用价值。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of talking head generation. However, the slow inference speeds and non-autoregressive paradigms severely constrain the application of diffusion-based THG models. In this study, we propose REST, the first diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through high spatiotemporal VAE compression. Additionally, to enable autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles to key-value caching for maintaining temporal consistency and identity coherence during long-time streaming generation. Furthermore, an Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) training strategy is proposed to mitigate error accumulation in autoregressive generation and enhance temporal consistency, which leverages a non-streaming teacher with an asynchronous noise schedule to supervise the training of the streaming student model. REST bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches, demonstrating substantial value for applications requiring real-time talking head generation. Experimental results demonstrate that REST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generation speed and overall performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoomPilot 是一个统一框架，通过将多模态输入（如文本或CAD平面图）解析为室内领域特定语言（IDSL），实现可控、交互性强且高质量的3D室内场景生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成室内场景时要么支持的输入模态有限，要么依赖随机过程导致可控性差，难以满足游戏开发、建筑可视化和具身AI训练等应用对可控性和交互性的需求。

Method: 提出RoomPilot框架，将文本描述或CAD平面图等多模态输入转换为室内领域特定语言（IDSL），利用IDSL作为共享语义表示，并结合带有交互标注的资产数据集生成具有真实物体行为的结构化室内场景。

Result: 实验证明RoomPilot具备强大的多模态理解能力、细粒度的场景可控性，以及更优的物理一致性和视觉保真度。

Conclusion: RoomPilot显著推进了通用可控3D室内场景生成的发展，为需要高可控性与交互性的应用场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating controllable and interactive indoor scenes is fundamental to applications in game development, architectural visualization, and embodied AI training. Yet existing approaches either handle a narrow range of input modalities or rely on stochastic processes that hinder controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce RoomPilot, a unified framework that parses diverse multi-modal inputs--textual descriptions or CAD floor plans--into an Indoor Domain-Specific Language (IDSL) for indoor structured scene generation. The key insight is that a well-designed IDSL can act as a shared semantic representation, enabling coherent, high-quality scene synthesis from any single modality while maintaining interaction semantics. In contrast to conventional procedural methods that produce visually plausible but functionally inert layouts, RoomPilot leverages a curated dataset of interaction-annotated assets to synthesize environments exhibiting realistic object behaviors. Extensive experiments further validate its strong multi-modal understanding, fine-grained controllability in scene generation, and superior physical consistency and visual fidelity, marking a significant step toward general-purpose controllable 3D indoor scene generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WildCap 是一种从野外智能手机视频中高质量捕捉面部外观的新方法，通过混合逆渲染框架有效分离复杂光照下的高保真反射率，显著缩小了野外与可控环境下捕捉质量的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖可控光照条件进行高质量面部外观捕捉，成本高且实用性受限；因此需要一种能在自然光照条件下（即“野外”）实现同样高质量捕捉的方法。

Method: 提出 WildCap 方法，结合数据驱动（SwitchLight）和基于模型的逆渲染：首先用 SwitchLight 将野外图像转换为更受控的条件，再引入 texel grid lighting 模型解释非物理效应，并在优化过程中联合采样扩散先验以解决光照与反照率之间的尺度模糊问题。

Result: 在相同采集设置下，WildCap 的结果显著优于现有方法，大幅缩小了野外与可控环境录制之间的质量差距。

Conclusion: WildCap 成功实现了在自然光照条件下从普通手机视频中高质量重建面部外观，具有低成本、高可用性的优势，推动了面部捕捉技术的实际应用。

Abstract: Existing methods achieve high-quality facial appearance capture under controllable lighting, which increases capture cost and limits usability. We propose WildCap, a novel method for high-quality facial appearance capture from a smartphone video recorded in the wild. To disentangle high-quality reflectance from complex lighting effects in in-the-wild captures, we propose a novel hybrid inverse rendering framework. Specifically, we first apply a data-driven method, i.e., SwitchLight, to convert the captured images into more constrained conditions and then adopt model-based inverse rendering. However, unavoidable local artifacts in network predictions, such as shadow-baking, are non-physical and thus hinder accurate inverse rendering of lighting and material. To address this, we propose a novel texel grid lighting model to explain non-physical effects as clean albedo illuminated by local physical lighting. During optimization, we jointly sample a diffusion prior for reflectance maps and optimize the lighting, effectively resolving scale ambiguity between local lights and albedo. Our method achieves significantly better results than prior arts in the same capture setup, closing the quality gap between in-the-wild and controllable recordings by a large margin. Our code will be released \href{https://yxuhan.github.io/WildCap/index.html}{\textcolor{magenta}{here}}.

Motivation: 在不完整多模态情感识别中，由于数据缺失导致模态间性能差异和欠优化问题，限制了多模态学习的有效性，亟需一种能有效利用部分观测数据并提升各模态协同能力的方法。

Method: 提出Cross-modal Prompting（ComP）方法，包含渐进式提示生成模块（带动态梯度调制器）、跨模态知识传播机制以增强一致信息，并设计协调器动态重加权各模态输出以平衡融合策略。

Result: 在4个数据集上、7种SOTA方法及不同缺失率条件下进行的大量实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的ComP方法通过强化模态特异性特征的一致性和判别能力，有效缓解了不完整多模态情感识别中的模态欠优化问题，显著提升了整体识别性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal emotion recognition (IMER) aims at understanding human intentions and sentiments by comprehensively exploring the partially observed multi-source data. Although the multi-modal data is expected to provide more abundant information, the performance gap and modality under-optimization problem hinder effective multi-modal learning in practice, and are exacerbated in the confrontation of the missing data. To address this issue, we devise a novel Cross-modal Prompting (ComP) method, which emphasizes coherent information by enhancing modality-specific features and improves the overall recognition accuracy by boosting each modality's performance. Specifically, a progressive prompt generation module with a dynamic gradient modulator is proposed to produce concise and consistent modality semantic cues. Meanwhile, cross-modal knowledge propagation selectively amplifies the consistent information in modality features with the delivered prompts to enhance the discrimination of the modality-specific output. Additionally, a coordinator is designed to dynamically re-weight the modality outputs as a complement to the balance strategy to improve the model's efficacy. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets with 7 SOTA methods under different missing rates validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的高效机器遗忘方法，通过解耦视觉与文本知识，并利用视觉知识蒸馏（VKD）机制，在保留文本能力的同时精准擦除目标视觉信息，在效果、效率及抗重学习攻击方面均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器遗忘方法主要针对纯语言大模型（LLM），而面向多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的遗忘研究尚处初期；同时，现有方法多依赖输出层监督，难以精准控制多模态知识的遗忘。

Method: 提出一种基于视觉知识蒸馏（VKD）的遗忘方法，利用MLLM内部中间视觉表征作为监督信号，仅微调视觉组件，以选择性擦除目标视觉知识，同时保留文本知识。

Result: 实验表明该方法在遗忘效果和模型效用上优于当前最先进的方法，并首次评估了MLLM遗忘方法在重学习攻击下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提方法为MLLM提供了一种高效、有效且鲁棒的机器遗忘方案，推动了多模态模型隐私保护与可控编辑的研究。

Abstract: Recently, machine unlearning approaches have been proposed to remove sensitive information from well-trained large models. However, most existing methods are tailored for LLMs, while MLLM-oriented unlearning remains at its early stage. Inspired by recent studies exploring the internal mechanisms of MLLMs, we propose to disentangle the visual and textual knowledge embedded within MLLMs and introduce a dedicated approach to selectively erase target visual knowledge while preserving textual knowledge. Unlike previous unlearning methods that rely on output-level supervision, our approach introduces a Visual Knowledge Distillation (VKD) scheme, which leverages intermediate visual representations within the MLLM as supervision signals. This design substantially enhances both unlearning effectiveness and model utility. Moreover, since our method only fine-tunes the visual components of the MLLM, it offers significant efficiency advantages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, we are the first to evaluate the robustness of MLLM unlearning against relearning attacks.

Abstract: Current diffusion-based portrait animation models predominantly focus on enhancing visual quality and expression realism, while overlooking generation latency and real-time performance, which restricts their application range in the live streaming scenario. We propose PersonaLive, a novel diffusion-based framework towards streaming real-time portrait animation with multi-stage training recipes. Specifically, we first adopt hybrid implicit signals, namely implicit facial representations and 3D implicit keypoints, to achieve expressive image-level motion control. Then, a fewer-step appearance distillation strategy is proposed to eliminate appearance redundancy in the denoising process, greatly improving inference efficiency. Finally, we introduce an autoregressive micro-chunk streaming generation paradigm equipped with a sliding training strategy and a historical keyframe mechanism to enable low-latency and stable long-term video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PersonaLive achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 7-22x speedup over prior diffusion-based portrait animation models.

Conclusion: 结合运动线索（特别是RGB与光流融合）的Transformer架构能显著提升交通事故检测的准确性与泛化能力，所构建的数据集为未来研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Road traffic accidents represent a leading cause of mortality globally, with incidence rates rising due to increasing population, urbanization, and motorization. Rising accident rates raise concerns about traffic surveillance effectiveness. Traditional computer vision methods for accident detection struggle with limited spatiotemporal understanding and poor cross-domain generalization. Recent advances in transformer architectures excel at modeling global spatial-temporal dependencies and parallel computation. However, applying these models to automated traffic accident detection is limited by small, non-diverse datasets, hindering the development of robust, generalizable systems. To address this gap, we curated a comprehensive and balanced dataset that captures a wide spectrum of traffic environments, accident types, and contextual variations. Utilizing the curated dataset, we propose an accident detection model based on a transformer architecture using pre-extracted spatial video features. The architecture employs convolutional layers to extract local correlations across diverse patterns within a frame, while leveraging transformers to capture sequential-temporal dependencies among the retrieved features. Moreover, most existing studies neglect the integration of motion cues, which are essential for understanding dynamic scenes, especially during accidents. These approaches typically rely on static features or coarse temporal information. In this study, multiple methods for incorporating motion cues were evaluated to identify the most effective strategy. Among the tested input approaches, concatenating RGB features with optical flow achieved the highest accuracy at 88.3%. The results were further compared with vision language models (VLM) such as GPT, Gemini, and LLaVA-NeXT-Video to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: Flowception 是一种新颖的非自回归、可变长度视频生成框架，通过在离散帧插入与连续帧去噪之间交替学习概率路径，在减少计算开销的同时提升了生成质量，并支持多任务集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归方法存在误差累积问题，而全序列流方法计算成本高且难以处理可变长度视频；Flowception 旨在克服这些限制。

Method: Flowception 学习一个概率路径，交替进行离散帧插入和连续帧去噪，从而高效压缩长期上下文信息，并联合学习视频长度与内容。

Result: 实验表明 Flowception 在 FVD 和 VBench 指标上优于自回归和全序列基线方法，且能有效支持图像到视频生成与视频插帧等任务。

Conclusion: Flowception 提供了一种高效、灵活的视频生成方案，在性能、计算效率和任务通用性方面均具有优势。

Abstract: We present Flowception, a novel non-autoregressive and variable-length video generation framework. Flowception learns a probability path that interleaves discrete frame insertions with continuous frame denoising. Compared to autoregressive methods, Flowception alleviates error accumulation/drift as the frame insertion mechanism during sampling serves as an efficient compression mechanism to handle long-term context. Compared to full-sequence flows, our method reduces FLOPs for training three-fold, while also being more amenable to local attention variants, and allowing to learn the length of videos jointly with their content. Quantitative experimental results show improved FVD and VBench metrics over autoregressive and full-sequence baselines, which is further validated with qualitative results. Finally, by learning to insert and denoise frames in a sequence, Flowception seamlessly integrates different tasks such as image-to-video generation and video interpolation.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多时相Sentinel-2卫星影像在景观尺度上监测入侵草种锯齿 tussock（Nassella trichotoma）的可行性，发现其结合光谱、纹理、植被指数和季节性特征的模型略优于高分辨率航空影像模型，具有成本效益和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前地面调查和航空影像方法难以实现对锯齿 tussock 的大范围监测，而卫星遥感虽空间分辨率较低但更具可扩展性和成本效益，因此需评估其在入侵物种监测中的潜力。

Method: 利用Sentinel-2多时相影像，构建11种不同组合的模型（包括光谱波段、纹理特征、植被指数和季节数据），采用随机森林分类器进行分类，并与航空影像模型在同一数据集上比较性能。

Result: 最佳Sentinel-2模型（M76*）总体精度（OA）达68%，总体Kappa系数（OK）为0.55，略优于航空影像模型（OA 67%，OK 0.52）。

Conclusion: 多季节特征增强的Sentinel-2卫星遥感模型在入侵植物大范围监测中具有应用潜力，是一种具成本效益且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Invasive species pose major global threats to ecosystems and agriculture. Serrated tussock (\textit{Nassella trichotoma}) is a highly competitive invasive grass species that disrupts native grasslands, reduces pasture productivity, and increases land management costs. In Victoria, Australia, it presents a major challenge due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact. While current ground surveys and subsequent management practices are effective at small scales, they are not feasible for landscape-scale monitoring. Although aerial imagery offers high spatial resolution suitable for detailed classification, its high cost limits scalability. Satellite-based remote sensing provides a more cost-effective and scalable alternative, though often with lower spatial resolution. This study evaluates whether multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, despite its lower spatial resolution, can provide a comparable and cost-effective alternative for landscape-scale monitoring of serrated tussock by leveraging its higher spectral resolution and seasonal phenological information. A total of eleven models have been developed using various combinations of spectral bands, texture features, vegetation indices, and seasonal data. Using a random forest classifier, the best-performing Sentinel-2 model (M76*) has achieved an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 68\% and an Overall Kappa (OK) of 0.55, slightly outperforming the best-performing aerial imaging model's OA of 67\% and OK of 0.52 on the same dataset. These findings highlight the potential of multi-seasonal feature-enhanced satellite-based models for scalable invasive species classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FilmWeaver 是一种新型视频生成框架，通过自回归扩散机制和双层缓存设计（镜头记忆与时间记忆），实现任意长度、多镜头视频的一致性生成，并支持灵活交互及下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在单镜头合成方面表现良好，但在多镜头视频生成中难以保持角色与背景的一致性，且无法灵活生成任意长度和镜头数量的视频。

Method: 采用自回归扩散范式实现任意长度视频生成，并引入双层缓存机制：镜头记忆用于缓存前序镜头的关键帧以维持角色与场景一致性，时间记忆用于保留当前镜头的历史帧以确保运动连贯性；同时支持多轮用户交互及多概念注入、视频延展等下游任务。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在一致性和美学质量指标上优于现有方法，并构建了高质量多镜头视频数据集以支持训练。

Conclusion: FilmWeaver 有效解决了多镜头视频生成中的一致性与可控性问题，为叙事驱动的视频内容创作提供了新可能。

Abstract: Current video generation models perform well at single-shot synthesis but struggle with multi-shot videos, facing critical challenges in maintaining character and background consistency across shots and flexibly generating videos of arbitrary length and shot count. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{FilmWeaver}, a novel framework designed to generate consistent, multi-shot videos of arbitrary length. First, it employs an autoregressive diffusion paradigm to achieve arbitrary-length video generation. To address the challenge of consistency, our key insight is to decouple the problem into inter-shot consistency and intra-shot coherence. We achieve this through a dual-level cache mechanism: a shot memory caches keyframes from preceding shots to maintain character and scene identity, while a temporal memory retains a history of frames from the current shot to ensure smooth, continuous motion. The proposed framework allows for flexible, multi-round user interaction to create multi-shot videos. Furthermore, due to this decoupled design, our method demonstrates high versatility by supporting downstream tasks such as multi-concept injection and video extension. To facilitate the training of our consistency-aware method, we also developed a comprehensive pipeline to construct a high-quality multi-shot video dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches on metrics for both consistency and aesthetic quality, opening up new possibilities for creating more consistent, controllable, and narrative-driven video content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在牙科领域难以捕捉细粒度的视觉细节，且缺乏精准诊断所需的推理能力，限制了其在自动化口腔医疗中的应用。

Method: 构建包含12万+牙科图像及其详细描述的最大牙科多模态数据集，用于增强模型的视觉理解；随后引入强化学习阶段以提升复杂多模态推理能力。

Result: DentalGPT在口内照、全景片及医学VQA牙科子集等基准测试中表现优异，在疾病分类和牙科视觉问答任务上优于多个先进多模态大模型，即使其参数量仅为7B。

Conclusion: 高质量的牙科数据结合分阶段的模型适配策略，是构建高效、专业化牙科多模态大语言模型的有效路径。

Abstract: Reliable interpretation of multimodal data in dentistry is essential for automated oral healthcare, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained dental visual details and lack sufficient reasoning ability for precise diagnosis. To address these limitations, we present DentalGPT, a specialized dental MLLM developed through high-quality domain knowledge injection and reinforcement learning. Specifically, the largest annotated multimodal dataset for dentistry to date was constructed by aggregating over 120k dental images paired with detailed descriptions that highlight diagnostically relevant visual features, making it the multimodal dataset with the most extensive collection of dental images to date. Training on this dataset significantly enhances the MLLM's visual understanding of dental conditions, while the subsequent reinforcement learning stage further strengthens its capability for multimodal complex reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on intraoral and panoramic benchmarks, along with dental subsets of medical VQA benchmarks, show that DentalGPT achieves superior performance in disease classification and dental VQA tasks, outperforming many state-of-the-art MLLMs despite having only 7B parameters. These results demonstrate that high-quality dental data combined with staged adaptation provides an effective pathway for building capable and domain-specialized dental MLLMs.

Conclusion: ARVAE通过时空解耦和自回归机制有效提升了视频自编码的效率与质量，为视频生成等下游任务提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Video autoencoders compress videos into compact latent representations for efficient reconstruction, playing a vital role in enhancing the quality and efficiency of video generation. However, existing video autoencoders often entangle spatial and temporal information, limiting their ability to capture temporal consistency and leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose Autoregressive Video Autoencoder (ARVAE), which compresses and reconstructs each frame conditioned on its predecessor in an autoregressive manner, allowing flexible processing of videos with arbitrary lengths. ARVAE introduces a temporal-spatial decoupled representation that combines downsampled flow field for temporal coherence with spatial relative compensation for newly emerged content, achieving high compression efficiency without information loss. Specifically, the encoder compresses the current and previous frames into the temporal motion and spatial supplement, while the decoder reconstructs the original frame from the latent representations given the preceding frame. A multi-stage training strategy is employed to progressively optimize the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARVAE achieves superior reconstruction quality with extremely lightweight models and small-scale training data. Moreover, evaluations on video generation tasks highlight its strong potential for downstream applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于多时相SAR影像并行处理与特征图间时间信息交互的新方法，以提升海洋终止冰川崩解锋自动提取的精度，并在CaFFe数据集上达到新的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在利用合成孔径雷达（SAR）影像自动提取冰川崩解锋时，常因季节性因素（如冰碎屑或积雪覆盖）导致分类错误，亟需更稳健的方法。

Method: 将同一冰川的多期卫星影像并行输入模型，在对应特征图之间交换时间信息以稳定每帧预测，并将该策略集成到当前最先进的Tyrion架构中。

Result: 在CaFFe基准数据集上取得新最优结果，平均距离误差为184.4米，平均交并比（IoU）达83.6%。

Conclusion: 通过引入多时相信息交互机制，有效提升了冰川崩解锋提取的鲁棒性和精度，为冰川动态监测提供了更可靠的技术手段。

Abstract: The calving fronts of marine-terminating glaciers undergo constant changes. These changes significantly affect the glacier's mass and dynamics, demanding continuous monitoring. To address this need, deep learning models were developed that can automatically delineate the calving front in Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. However, these models often struggle to correctly classify areas affected by seasonal conditions such as ice melange or snow-covered surfaces. To address this issue, we propose to process multiple frames from a satellite image time series of the same glacier in parallel and exchange temporal information between the corresponding feature maps to stabilize each prediction. We integrate our approach into the current state-of-the-art architecture Tyrion and accomplish a new state-of-the-art performance on the CaFFe benchmark dataset. In particular, we achieve a Mean Distance Error of 184.4 m and a mean Intersection over Union of 83.6.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了AI图像模型指纹检测技术在对抗环境下的安全性，发现现有方法在面对移除和伪造攻击时普遍存在显著性能下降，揭示了准确性与鲁棒性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型指纹检测技术在对抗条件下的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究，缺乏对其安全性的系统评估。

Method: 作者形式化了白盒和黑盒两种威胁模型及指纹移除与伪造两类攻击目标，实现了五种攻击策略，并在12个先进图像生成器上对14种代表性指纹方法（涵盖RGB、频域和学习特征域）进行了评估。

Result: 实验表明，移除攻击在白盒下成功率常超80%，黑盒下也超50%；伪造攻击虽更具挑战性但效果因目标模型而异。高准确率的指纹方法往往更易受攻击，尚无方法能在所有威胁模型下同时保持高鲁棒性与高准确性。

Conclusion: 现有模型指纹技术在对抗环境下存在明显脆弱性，未来需发展兼顾鲁棒性与准确性的新方法，并指出了最有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Model fingerprint detection techniques have emerged as a promising approach for attributing AI-generated images to their source models, but their robustness under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under constrained black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success significantly varies across targeted models. We also identify a utility-robustness trade-off: methods with the highest attribution accuracy are often vulnerable to attacks. Although some techniques exhibit robustness in specific settings, none achieves high robustness and accuracy across all evaluated threat models. These findings highlight the need for techniques balancing robustness and accuracy, and identify the most promising approaches for advancing this goal.

Abstract: Multi-view egocentric dynamic scene reconstruction holds significant research value for applications in holographic documentation of social interactions. However, existing reconstruction datasets focus on static multi-view or single-egocentric view setups, lacking multi-view egocentric datasets for dynamic scene reconstruction. Therefore, we present MultiEgo, the first multi-view egocentric dataset for 4D dynamic scene reconstruction.

Each scene provides five authentic egocentric videos captured by participants wearing AR glasses. We design a hardware-based data acquisition system and processing pipeline, achieving sub-millisecond temporal synchronization across views, coupled with accurate pose annotations. Experiment validation demonstrates the practical utility and effectiveness of our dataset for free-viewpoint video (FVV) applications, establishing MultiEgo as a foundational resource for advancing multi-view egocentric dynamic scene reconstruction research.

TL;DR: Particulate 是一种基于 Transformer 的前馈方法，能够从单个静态 3D 网格直接推断出其完整的关节结构（包括部件、运动学结构和运动约束），在速度和精度上均优于现有方法，并支持 AI 生成的 3D 资产。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖逐对象优化，速度慢且难以扩展；同时缺乏对 AI 生成 3D 资产的关节结构提取能力。因此需要一种快速、通用且端到端可训练的方法来实现对日常物体 3D 关节结构的高效推断。

Method: 提出 Part Articulation Transformer，利用灵活可扩展的 Transformer 架构处理输入网格的点云，直接预测 3D 部件、运动学结构及运动约束；模型在多个公开数据集上端到端训练，并引入新的评估基准与更符合人类偏好的评估协议。

Conclusion: Particulate 提供了一种高效、准确且通用的 3D 关节结构推断方案，适用于真实与合成 3D 数据，在速度和性能上实现了突破，为从单图生成可动画 3D 对象提供了可行路径。

Abstract: We present Particulate, a feed-forward approach that, given a single static 3D mesh of an everyday object, directly infers all attributes of the underlying articulated structure, including its 3D parts, kinematic structure, and motion constraints. At its core is a transformer network, Part Articulation Transformer, which processes a point cloud of the input mesh using a flexible and scalable architecture to predict all the aforementioned attributes with native multi-joint support. We train the network end-to-end on a diverse collection of articulated 3D assets from public datasets. During inference, Particulate lifts the network's feed-forward prediction to the input mesh, yielding a fully articulated 3D model in seconds, much faster than prior approaches that require per-object optimization. Particulate can also accurately infer the articulated structure of AI-generated 3D assets, enabling full-fledged extraction of articulated 3D objects from a single (real or synthetic) image when combined with an off-the-shelf image-to-3D generator. We further introduce a new challenging benchmark for 3D articulation estimation curated from high-quality public 3D assets, and redesign the evaluation protocol to be more consistent with human preferences. Quantitative and qualitative results show that Particulate significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精地图实时构建受限于车载传感器数据质量低（如遮挡、噪声、缺失），而现有引入卫星图像的方法因阴影和遮挡问题及简单融合策略效果有限。

Method: 提出SATMapTR模型，包含：(1) 门控特征精炼模块，结合高层语义与低层结构信息自适应过滤卫星图像特征；(2) 几何感知融合模块，在网格级别一致融合卫星与BEV特征，抑制无关区域干扰。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，SATMapTR达到73.8 mAP，比当前最优的卫星增强模型高出最多14.2 mAP；在恶劣天气、传感器失效下mAP下降更小，并在远距离感知范围获得近3倍mAP提升。

Conclusion: SATMapTR通过有效融合卫星图像与车载感知数据，显著提升了高精地图在线构建的准确性、鲁棒性与远距离性能，为自动驾驶提供了更可靠的实时地图支持。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are evolving from pre-annotated to real-time construction to better support autonomous driving in diverse scenarios. However, this process is hindered by low-quality input data caused by onboard sensors limited capability and frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete, noisy, or missing data, and thus reduced mapping accuracy and robustness. Recent efforts have introduced satellite images as auxiliary input, offering a stable, wide-area view to complement the limited ego perspective. However, satellite images in Bird's Eye View are often degraded by shadows and occlusions from vegetation and buildings. Prior methods using basic feature extraction and fusion remain ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SATMapTR, a novel online map construction model that effectively fuses satellite image through two key components: (1) a gated feature refinement module that adaptively filters satellite image features by integrating high-level semantics with low-level structural cues to extract high signal-to-noise ratio map-relevant representations; and (2) a geometry-aware fusion module that consistently fuse satellite and BEV features at a grid-to-grid level, minimizing interference from irrelevant regions and low-quality inputs. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show that SATMapTR achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 73.8, outperforming state-of-the-art satellite-enhanced models by up to 14.2 mAP. It also shows lower mAP degradation under adverse weather and sensor failures, and achieves nearly 3 times higher mAP at extended perception ranges.

Abstract: Generating dynamic 3D facial animation from natural language requires understanding both temporally structured semantics and fine-grained expression changes. Existing datasets and methods mainly focus on speech-driven animation or unstructured expression sequences and therefore lack the semantic grounding and temporal structures needed for expressive human performance generation. In this work, we introduce KeyframeFace, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed for text-to-animation research through keyframe-level supervision. KeyframeFace provides 2,100 expressive scripts paired with monocular videos, per-frame ARKit coefficients, contextual backgrounds, complex emotions, manually defined keyframes, and multi-perspective annotations based on ARKit coefficients and images via Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Beyond the dataset, we propose the first text-to-animation framework that explicitly leverages LLM priors for interpretable facial motion synthesis. This design aligns the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs with the interpretable structure of ARKit's coefficients, enabling high-fidelity expressive animation. KeyframeFace and our LLM-based framework together establish a new foundation for interpretable, keyframe-guided, and context-aware text-to-animation.

Abstract: Ultrasound image segmentation is pivotal for clinical diagnosis, yet challenged by speckle noise and imaging artifacts. Recently, DINOv3 has shown remarkable promise in medical image segmentation with its powerful representation capabilities. However, DINOv3, pre-trained on natural images, lacks sensitivity to ultrasound-specific boundary degradation. To address this limitation, we propose FreqDINO, a frequency-guided segmentation framework that enhances boundary perception and structural consistency. Specifically, we devise a Multi-scale Frequency Extraction and Alignment (MFEA) strategy to separate low-frequency structures and multi-scale high-frequency boundary details, and align them via learnable attention. We also introduce a Frequency-Guided Boundary Refinement (FGBR) module that extracts boundary prototypes from high-frequency components and refines spatial features. Furthermore, we design a Multi-task Boundary-Guided Decoder (MBGD) to ensure spatial coherence between boundary and semantic predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDINO surpasses state-of-the-art methods with superior achieves remarkable generalization capability.

Abstract: With the advancement of multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs), Video LLMs have been further developed to perform on holistic and specialized video understanding. However, existing works are limited to specialized video understanding tasks, failing to achieve a comprehensive and multi-grained video perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce UFVideo, the first Video LLM with unified multi-grained cooperative understanding capabilities. Specifically, we design unified visual-language guided alignment to flexibly handle video understanding across global, pixel and temporal scales within a single model. UFVideo dynamically encodes the visual and text inputs of different tasks and generates the textual response, temporal localization, or grounded mask. Additionally, to evaluate challenging multi-grained video understanding tasks, we construct the UFVideo-Bench consisting of three distinct collaborative tasks within the scales, which demonstrates UFVideo's flexibility and advantages over GPT-4o. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our model across 9 public benchmarks covering various common video understanding tasks, providing valuable insights for future Video LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出TS-FSAR框架，通过引入视觉Ladder Side Network（LSN）、任务特定距离相关匹配（TS-DCM）度量和GLAC模块，在少样本动作识别任务中有效建模帧间线性与非线性依赖关系，并提升CLIP模型在有限数据下的微调效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本动作识别方法存在两个主要问题：一是基于余弦相似度的集合匹配度量仅利用实例级信息，无法捕捉非线性关系和任务特定线索；二是基于侧边层（side layers）的CLIP高效微调方法在数据有限时难以优化。

Method: 提出TS-FSAR框架，包含三个组件：(1) 用于高效微调CLIP的视觉Ladder Side Network（LSN）；(2) 使用α-距离相关度量帧间线性和非线性依赖并结合任务原型进行匹配的TS-DCM；(3) 利用已适配的冻结CLIP对LSN进行正则化的GLAC模块，以在有限监督下提升α-距离相关估计的训练效果。

Result: 在五个广泛使用的基准数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明TS-FSAR优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TS-FSAR通过建模更丰富的帧间依赖关系和改进CLIP微调策略，显著提升了少样本动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot action recognition (FSAR) has recently made notable progress through set matching and efficient adaptation of large-scale pre-trained models. However, two key limitations persist. First, existing set matching metrics typically rely on cosine similarity to measure inter-frame linear dependencies and then perform matching with only instance-level information, thus failing to capture more complex patterns such as nonlinear relationships and overlooking task-specific cues. Second, for efficient adaptation of CLIP to FSAR, recent work performing fine-tuning via skip-fusion layers (which we refer to as side layers) has significantly reduced memory cost. However, the newly introduced side layers are often difficult to optimize under limited data conditions. To address these limitations, we propose TS-FSAR, a framework comprising three components: (1) a visual Ladder Side Network (LSN) for efficient CLIP fine-tuning; (2) a metric called Task-Specific Distance Correlation Matching (TS-DCM), which uses $α$-distance correlation to model both linear and nonlinear inter-frame dependencies and leverages a task prototype to enable task-specific matching; and (3) a Guiding LSN with Adapted CLIP (GLAC) module, which regularizes LSN using the adapted frozen CLIP to improve training for better $α$-distance correlation estimation under limited supervision. Extensive experiments on five widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our TS-FSAR yields superior performance compared to prior state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: We introduce a fully automatic pipeline for dynamic scene reconstruction from casually captured monocular RGB videos. Rather than designing a new scene representation, we enhance the priors that drive Dynamic Gaussian Splatting. Video segmentation combined with epipolar-error maps yields object-level masks that closely follow thin structures; these masks (i) guide an object-depth loss that sharpens the consistent video depth, and (ii) support skeleton-based sampling plus mask-guided re-identification to produce reliable, comprehensive 2-D tracks. Two additional objectives embed the refined priors in the reconstruction stage: a virtual-view depth loss removes floaters, and a scaffold-projection loss ties motion nodes to the tracks, preserving fine geometry and coherent motion. The resulting system surpasses previous monocular dynamic scene reconstruction methods and delivers visibly superior renderings

Abstract: Efficient crop detection via Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is critical for scaling precision agriculture, yet it remains challenging due to the small scale of targets and environmental variability. This paper addresses the detection of rice seedlings in paddy fields by leveraging a Faster R-CNN architecture initialized via transfer learning. To overcome the specific difficulties of detecting minute objects in high-resolution aerial imagery, we curate a significant UAV dataset for training and rigorously evaluate the model's generalization capabilities. Specifically, we validate performance across three distinct test sets acquired at different temporal intervals, thereby assessing robustness against varying imaging conditions. Our empirical results demonstrate that transfer learning not only facilitates the rapid convergence of object detection models in agricultural contexts but also yields consistent performance despite domain shifts in image acquisition.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于伪装目标检测（COD）的新模型ARNet-v2，通过引入通道信息交互模块（CIIM）、边界与区域协同解码架构以及多尺度增强模块（MSE），有效提升了特征表达能力和边界-区域联合建模能力，在多个COD基准数据集上达到领先性能，并在多个下游任务中展现出良好泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的伪装目标检测方法在解码阶段存在两个关键问题：一是同层特征内部跨通道信息交互不足，限制了特征表达能力；二是难以有效联合建模边界与区域信息，导致目标区域不完整和边界模糊。

Method: 作者提出了三个核心组件：1）通道信息交互模块（CIIM），通过水平-垂直整合机制在通道维度进行特征重组与交互；2）由先验知识引导的协同解码架构，利用边界提取（BE）和区域提取（RE）模块生成先验信息，并通过混合注意力机制协同校准解码特征；3）多尺度增强（MSE）模块以丰富上下文特征表示。

Result: 在四个COD基准数据集上的大量实验验证了所提模型的有效性，并取得了当前最优的性能。此外，该模型成功迁移到显著性目标检测（SOD）及其他下游任务（如息肉分割、透明物体检测、工业与道路缺陷检测）中，展现了良好的适应性。

Conclusion: 所提出的ARNet-v2模型通过增强通道间信息交互和边界-区域协同建模，显著提升了伪装目标检测的性能，并在多个相关视觉任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) stands as a significant challenge in computer vision, dedicated to identifying and segmenting objects visually highly integrated with their backgrounds. Current mainstream methods have made progress in cross-layer feature fusion, but two critical issues persist during the decoding stage. The first is insufficient cross-channel information interaction within the same-layer features, limiting feature expressiveness. The second is the inability to effectively co-model boundary and region information, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct complete regions and sharp boundaries of objects. To address the first issue, we propose the Channel Information Interaction Module (CIIM), which introduces a horizontal-vertical integration mechanism in the channel dimension. This module performs feature reorganization and interaction across channels to effectively capture complementary cross-channel information. To address the second issue, we construct a collaborative decoding architecture guided by prior knowledge. This architecture generates boundary priors and object localization maps through Boundary Extraction (BE) and Region Extraction (RE) modules, then employs hybrid attention to collaboratively calibrate decoded features, effectively overcoming semantic ambiguity and imprecise boundaries. Additionally, the Multi-scale Enhancement (MSE) module enriches contextual feature representations. Extensive experiments on four COD benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of the proposed model. We further transferred our model to the Salient Object Detection (SOD) task and demonstrated its adaptability across downstream tasks, including polyp segmentation, transparent object detection, and industrial and road defect detection.

*Zhifan Zhu,Yifei Huang,Yoichi Sato,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出“N体问题”：给定一段第一人称视频，推断N个人如何协作并行完成其中任务以最大化加速比。作者设计了评估性能与可行性的指标，并提出一种结构化提示策略，引导视觉语言模型推理3D环境、物体使用和时序依赖，从而生成可行的并行执行方案。在EPIC-Kitchens和HD-EPIC数据集上，该方法显著提升了任务覆盖率并大幅减少了冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能直观地将复杂活动并行化，但现有模型难以从单人视频中学习这种能力。直接将视频片段分配给多人常导致违反物理约束（如空间重叠、共用物体等），因此需要一种能兼顾加速效果与现实可行性的方法。

Method: 作者形式化定义了N体问题，并提出一套评估指标（包括加速比、任务覆盖率、空间碰撞、物体冲突和因果约束）。随后，他们设计了一种结构化提示策略，引导视觉语言模型（VLM）对3D环境、物体使用及时序依赖进行推理，以生成可行的多人并行执行计划。

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens和HD-EPIC的100个视频上，当N=2时，该方法相比基线提示在Gemini 2.5 Pro上将动作覆盖率提升45%，同时将碰撞率、物体冲突和因果冲突分别降低55%、45%和55%。

Conclusion: 通过结构化提示引导VLM进行环境与任务推理，可以有效解决从单人视频推断多人并行执行的N体问题，在提升效率的同时保证方案的物理可行性。

Abstract: Humans can intuitively parallelise complex activities, but can a model learn this from observing a single person? Given one egocentric video, we introduce the N-Body Problem: how N individuals, can hypothetically perform the same set of tasks observed in this video. The goal is to maximise speed-up, but naive assignment of video segments to individuals often violates real-world constraints, leading to physically impossible scenarios like two people using the same object or occupying the same space. To address this, we formalise the N-Body Problem and propose a suite of metrics to evaluate both performance (speed-up, task coverage) and feasibility (spatial collisions, object conflicts and causal constraints). We then introduce a structured prompting strategy that guides a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to reason about the 3D environment, object usage, and temporal dependencies to produce a viable parallel execution. On 100 videos from EPIC-Kitchens and HD-EPIC, our method for N = 2 boosts action coverage by 45% over a baseline prompt for Gemini 2.5 Pro, while simultaneously slashing collision rates, object and causal conflicts by 55%, 45% and 55% respectively.

Motivation: 当前文本驱动的复杂图像编辑（含多个编辑目标）面临单轮编辑语义对齐不足和多轮编辑累积不一致的问题，难以兼顾语义准确性与源图像一致性。

Method: 将复杂编辑解耦为多个子编辑效果并行处理；同时对流匹配模型中的速度场进行正交分解，衰减与编辑位移正交的速度分量以更好保留源结构。

Result: 在包括新构建的Complex-PIE-Bench在内的两个基准上，FlowDC在复杂编辑任务中表现优于现有方法，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: FlowDC通过并行解耦编辑和速度场正交分解，有效提升了复杂文本图像编辑中语义对齐与源一致性的平衡。

Abstract: With the surge of pre-trained text-to-image flow matching models, text-based image editing performance has gained remarkable improvement, especially for \underline{simple editing} that only contains a single editing target. To satisfy the exploding editing requirements, the \underline{complex editing} which contains multiple editing targets has posed as a more challenging task. However, current complex editing solutions: single-round and multi-round editing are limited by long text following and cumulative inconsistency, respectively. Thus, they struggle to strike a balance between semantic alignment and source consistency. In this paper, we propose \textbf{FlowDC}, which decouples the complex editing into multiple sub-editing effects and superposes them in parallel during the editing process. Meanwhile, we observed that the velocity quantity that is orthogonal to the editing displacement harms the source structure preserving. Thus, we decompose the velocity and decay the orthogonal part for better source consistency. To evaluate the effectiveness of complex editing settings, we construct a complex editing benchmark: Complex-PIE-Bench. On two benchmarks, FlowDC shows superior results compared with existing methods. We also detail the ablations of our module designs.

Motivation: 现有基于 DiT 的音频驱动头像生成方法受限于高计算开销和无法生成长视频；而自回归方法虽能生成长视频，却存在误差累积和质量下降问题。

Method: 提出 JoyAvatar 模型，包含三项核心技术：(1) 渐进式步引导（PSB），在初始帧分配更多去噪步骤以减少误差累积；(2) 运动条件注入（MCI），通过注入带噪前帧增强时间一致性；(3) 基于缓存重置的无界 RoPE（URCR），支持无限长度生成。

Result: 该 1.3B 参数的因果模型在单 GPU 上实现 16 FPS 的实时推理，并在视觉质量、时间一致性和唇音同步方面达到具有竞争力的效果。

Conclusion: JoyAvatar 有效解决了现有方法在长视频生成中的误差累积与效率瓶颈问题，为音频驱动头像生成提供了高效且可扩展的新方案。

Abstract: Existing DiT-based audio-driven avatar generation methods have achieved considerable progress, yet their broader application is constrained by limitations such as high computational overhead and the inability to synthesize long-duration videos. Autoregressive methods address this problem by applying block-wise autoregressive diffusion methods. However, these methods suffer from the problem of error accumulation and quality degradation. To address this, we propose JoyAvatar, an audio-driven autoregressive model capable of real-time inference and infinite-length video generation with the following contributions: (1) Progressive Step Bootstrapping (PSB), which allocates more denoising steps to initial frames to stabilize generation and reduce error accumulation; (2) Motion Condition Injection (MCI), enhancing temporal coherence by injecting noise-corrupted previous frames as motion condition; and (3) Unbounded RoPE via Cache-Resetting (URCR), enabling infinite-length generation through dynamic positional encoding. Our 1.3B-parameter causal model achieves 16 FPS on a single GPU and achieves competitive results in visual quality, temporal consistency, and lip synchronization.

Abstract: Driver fatigue remains a leading cause of road accidents, with 24\% of crashes involving drowsy drivers. While yawning serves as an early behavioral indicator of fatigue, existing machine learning approaches face significant challenges due to video-annotated datasets that introduce systematic noise from coarse temporal annotations. We develop a semi-automated labeling pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, which we apply to YawDD, enabling more accurate model training. Training the established MNasNet classifier and YOLOv11 detector architectures on YawDD+ improves frame accuracy by up to 6\% and mAP by 5\% over video-level supervision, achieving 99.34\% classification accuracy and 95.69\% detection mAP. The resulting approach deliver up to 59.8 FPS on edge AI hardware (NVIDIA Jetson Nano), confirming that enhanced data quality alone supports on-device yawning monitoring without server-side computation.

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have shown tremendous potential for learning 3D point cloud representations without human annotations. However, SSL for 3D point clouds still faces critical challenges due to irregular geometry, shortcut-prone reconstruction, and unbalanced semantics distribution. In this work, we propose DOS (Distilling Observable Softmaps), a novel SSL framework that self-distills semantic relevance softmaps only at observable (unmasked) points. This strategy prevents information leakage from masked regions and provides richer supervision than discrete token-to-prototype assignments. To address the challenge of unbalanced semantics in an unsupervised setting, we introduce Zipfian prototypes and incorporate them using a modified Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, Zipf-Sinkhorn, which enforces a power-law prior over prototype usage and modulates the sharpness of the target softmap during training. DOS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on semantic segmentation and 3D object detection across multiple benchmarks, including nuScenes, Waymo, SemanticKITTI, ScanNet, and ScanNet200, without relying on extra data or annotations. Our results demonstrate that observable-point softmaps distillation offers a scalable and effective paradigm for learning robust 3D representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADMorph 是一种用于几何驱动参数化 CAD 编辑的迭代框架，通过结合预训练的参数到形状（P2S）扩散模型和掩码参数预测（MPP）模型，在无需三元组训练数据的情况下，实现结构保持、语义有效性和高形状保真度。

Motivation: 在 CAD 模型的迭代设计中，对几何形状的调整需同步修改其底层参数序列，但现有方法难以在数据稀缺条件下同时满足结构保留、语义有效性和形状保真度的要求。

Method: 提出 CADMorph 框架，包含计划-生成-验证三个阶段：利用 P2S 模型的交叉注意力图识别需修改区域并生成编辑掩码；MPP 模型填充掩码以生成语义有效的参数编辑；再通过 P2S 模型在形状潜在空间中评估并选择最接近目标形状的候选序列。两个模型均无需三元组数据训练。

Result: CADMorph 在性能上超越 GPT-4o 和专用 CAD 基线方法，并支持迭代编辑与逆向工程增强等下游应用。

Conclusion: CADMorph 有效解决了几何驱动参数化 CAD 编辑中的关键挑战，通过利用预训练模型的几何意识与设计知识，在数据稀缺场景下实现了高质量编辑。

Abstract: A Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model encodes an object in two coupled forms: a parametric construction sequence and its resulting visible geometric shape. During iterative design, adjustments to the geometric shape inevitably require synchronized edits to the underlying parametric sequence, called geometry-driven parametric CAD editing. The task calls for 1) preserving the original sequence's structure, 2) ensuring each edit's semantic validity, and 3) maintaining high shape fidelity to the target shape, all under scarce editing data triplets. We present CADMorph, an iterative plan-generate-verify framework that orchestrates pretrained domain-specific foundation models during inference: a parameter-to-shape (P2S) latent diffusion model and a masked-parameter-prediction (MPP) model. In the planning stage, cross-attention maps from the P2S model pinpoint the segments that need modification and offer editing masks. The MPP model then infills these masks with semantically valid edits in the generation stage. During verification, the P2S model embeds each candidate sequence in shape-latent space, measures its distance to the target shape, and selects the closest one. The three stages leverage the inherent geometric consciousness and design knowledge in pretrained priors, and thus tackle structure preservation, semantic validity, and shape fidelity respectively. Besides, both P2S and MPP models are trained without triplet data, bypassing the data-scarcity bottleneck. CADMorph surpasses GPT-4o and specialized CAD baselines, and supports downstream applications such as iterative editing and reverse-engineering enhancement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGGT is a 3D foundation model that implicitly encodes geometric structures like epipolar geometry and performs correspondence matching through global attention, despite being trained without explicit geometric supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether VGGT relies on genuine geometric reasoning or merely on learned appearance-based priors, and to uncover how geometric understanding emerges in its internal representations.

Method: The authors probe intermediate features, analyze attention patterns, perform interventions, and conduct spatial masking and perturbation experiments to assess VGGT’s geometric reasoning and robustness.

Result: VGGT implicitly performs correspondence matching and encodes epipolar geometry within its global attention layers, showing reliance on both internalized geometric structure and learned data-driven priors.

Conclusion: VGGT integrates geometric understanding into its representations without explicit geometric training, blending classical geometry with data-driven learning.

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) is a 3D foundation model that infers camera geometry and scene structure in a single feed-forward pass. Trained in a supervised, single-step fashion on large datasets, VGGT raises a key question: does it build upon geometric concepts like traditional multi-view methods, or does it rely primarily on learned appearance-based data-driven priors? In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of VGGT's internal mechanisms to uncover whether geometric understanding emerges within its representations. By probing intermediate features, analyzing attention patterns, and performing interventions, we examine how the model implements its functionality. Our findings reveal that VGGT implicitly performs correspondence matching within its global attention layers and encodes epipolar geometry, despite being trained without explicit geometric constraints. We further investigate VGGT's dependence on its learned data priors. Using spatial input masking and perturbation experiments, we assess its robustness to occlusions, appearance variations, and camera configurations, comparing it with classical multi-stage pipelines. Together, these insights highlight how VGGT internalizes geometric structure while using learned data-driven priors.

Abstract: Fine-scale forest monitoring is essential for understanding canopy structure and its dynamics, which are key indicators of carbon stocks, biodiversity, and forest health. Deep learning is particularly effective for this task, as it integrates spectral, temporal, and spatial signals that jointly reflect the canopy structure. To address this need, we introduce THREASURE-Net, a novel end-to-end framework for Tree Height Regression And Super-Resolution. The model is trained on Sentinel-2 time series using reference height metrics derived from LiDAR HD data at multiple spatial resolutions over Metropolitan France to produce annual height maps. We evaluate three model variants, producing tree-height predictions at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution. THREASURE-Net does not rely on any pretrained model nor on reference very high resolution optical imagery to train its super-resolution module; instead, it learns solely from LiDAR-derived height information. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods based on Sentinel data and is competitive with methods based on very high resolution imagery. It can be deployed to generate high-precision annual canopy-height maps, achieving mean absolute errors of 2.62 m, 2.72 m, and 2.88 m at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution, respectively. These results highlight the potential of THREASURE-Net for scalable and cost-effective structural monitoring of temperate forests using only freely available satellite data. The source code for THREASURE-Net is available at: https://github.com/Global-Earth-Observation/threasure-net.

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决了传统关键帧选择方法的冗余与静态监督问题，实现了任务自适应、端到端优化的高性能视频理解。

Abstract: Key frame selection in video understanding presents significant challenges. Traditional top-K selection methods, which score frames independently, often fail to optimize the selection as a whole. This independent scoring frequently results in selecting frames that are temporally clustered and visually redundant. Additionally, training lightweight selectors using pseudo labels generated offline by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the supervisory signal from dynamically adapting to task objectives. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end trainable, task-adaptive framework for frame selection. A Chain-of-Thought approach guides a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate task-specific implicit query vectors, which are combined with multimodal features to enable dynamic frame scoring. We further define a continuous set-level objective function that incorporates relevance, coverage, and redundancy, enabling differentiable optimization via Gumbel-Softmax to select optimal frame combinations at the set level. Finally, student-teacher mutual learning is employed, where the student selector (SLM) and teacher reasoner (MLLM) are trained to align their frame importance distributions via KL divergence. Combined with cross-entropy loss, this enables end-to-end optimization, eliminating reliance on static pseudo labels. Experiments across various benchmarks, including Video-MME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and NExT-QA, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Achieving compositional alignment between textual descriptions and generated images - covering objects, attributes, and spatial relationships - remains a core challenge for modern text-to-image (T2I) models. Although diffusion-based architectures have been widely studied, the compositional behavior of emerging Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models is still largely unexamined. We benchmark six diverse T2I systems - SDXL, PixArt-$α$, Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Infinity-2B, and Infinity-8B - across the full T2I-CompBench++ and GenEval suites, evaluating alignment in color and attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy, and complex multi-object prompts. Across both benchmarks, Infinity-8B achieves the strongest overall compositional alignment, while Infinity-2B also matches or exceeds larger diffusion models in several categories, highlighting favorable efficiency-performance trade-offs. In contrast, SDXL and PixArt-$α$ show persistent weaknesses in attribute-sensitive and spatial tasks. These results provide the first systematic comparison of VAR and diffusion approaches to compositional alignment and establish unified baselines for the future development of the T2I model.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的半监督学习框架SSL-MedSAM2，结合预训练大模型SAM2进行无需训练的少样本伪标签生成，并利用nnUNet迭代优化伪标签，在MICCAI2025 CARE-LiSeg肝脏分割任务中取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注耗时且昂贵，限制了全监督深度学习模型在临床中的应用，因此需要一种能有效利用少量标注数据的半监督学习方法。

Method: SSL-MedSAM2框架包含两个分支：一是基于预训练SAM2模型的无需训练的少样本学习分支（TFFS-MedSAM2）用于生成伪标签；二是基于nnUNet的迭代全监督学习分支（FSL-nnUNet）用于优化伪标签。

Result: 在MICCAI2025 CARE-LiSeg挑战赛中，该方法在GED4和T1 MRI测试集上的Dice分数分别为0.9710和0.9648，Hausdorff距离分别为20.07和21.97，表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的SSL-MedSAM2框架在仅使用有限标注数据的情况下实现了高精度的肝脏分割，显著降低了标注成本，具有良好的临床应用前景。

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning based models in medical image segmentation, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods perform fully-supervised learning, which commonly rely on large scale annotated training datasets. However, medical image annotation is highly time-consuming, hindering its clinical applications. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been emerged as an appealing strategy in training with limited annotations, largely reducing the labelling cost. We propose a novel SSL framework SSL-MedSAM2, which contains a training-free few-shot learning branch TFFS-MedSAM2 based on the pretrained large foundation model Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for pseudo label generation, and an iterative fully-supervised learning branch FSL-nnUNet based on nnUNet for pseudo label refinement. The results on MICCAI2025 challenge CARE-LiSeg (Liver Segmentation) demonstrate an outstanding performance of SSL-MedSAM2 among other methods. The average dice scores on the test set in GED4 and T1 MRI are 0.9710 and 0.9648 respectively, and the Hausdorff distances are 20.07 and 21.97 respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出3DTeethSAM，通过将SAM2模型适配于3D牙齿分割任务，在3DTeethSeg基准上达到91.90%的IoU，刷新了该领域的SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D牙齿分割在数字牙科中至关重要但极具挑战，主要由于真实牙列结构复杂；现有方法难以兼顾实例定位与语义分类，因此需要更强大的分割模型。

Method: 将SAM2用于3D牙齿分割：从预定义视角渲染3D模型为2D图像，利用SAM2进行2D分割，并通过2D-3D投影重建3D结果；引入三个轻量可学习模块（提示嵌入生成器、掩码细化器、掩码分类器）并集成可变形全局注意力插件（DGAP）以提升精度与训练速度。

Result: 在3DTeethSeg基准测试中，该方法在高分辨率3D牙齿网格上实现了91.90%的IoU，达到当前最优性能。

Conclusion: 3DTeethSAM有效将SAM2迁移至3D牙齿分割任务，通过轻量模块与注意力机制显著提升分割精度和效率，为数字牙科提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: 3D teeth segmentation, involving the localization of tooth instances and their semantic categorization in 3D dental models, is a critical yet challenging task in digital dentistry due to the complexity of real-world dentition. In this paper, we propose 3DTeethSAM, an adaptation of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for 3D teeth segmentation. SAM2 is a pretrained foundation model for image and video segmentation, demonstrating a strong backbone in various downstream scenarios. To adapt SAM2 for 3D teeth data, we render images of 3D teeth models from predefined views, apply SAM2 for 2D segmentation, and reconstruct 3D results using 2D-3D projections. Since SAM2's performance depends on input prompts and its initial outputs often have deficiencies, and given its class-agnostic nature, we introduce three light-weight learnable modules: (1) a prompt embedding generator to derive prompt embeddings from image embeddings for accurate mask decoding, (2) a mask refiner to enhance SAM2's initial segmentation results, and (3) a mask classifier to categorize the generated masks. Additionally, we incorporate Deformable Global Attention Plugins (DGAP) into SAM2's image encoder. The DGAP enhances both the segmentation accuracy and the speed of the training process. Our method has been validated on the 3DTeethSeg benchmark, achieving an IoU of 91.90% on high-resolution 3D teeth meshes, establishing a new state-of-the-art in the field.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需微调的新型3D场景理解基准，通过扩展Hummingbird框架至3D多视角ImageNet数据集，直接评估基础模型编码器在不同视角变化下的密集视觉特征质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对基础模型3D空间理解能力的评估通常依赖下游任务微调，难以准确衡量预训练编码器本身的3D推理能力。

Method: 基于Hummingbird框架，将其从2D扩展到3D多视角ImageNet（MVImgNet）数据集，利用特定角度的图像（keys）对新视角（queries）进行分割，根据视角差异将难度分为easy、medium、hard和extreme四类，并在8个前沿基础模型上进行评测。

Result: 实验表明，DINO系列编码器在大视角变化下仍具竞争力，而如VGGT等3D感知模型则需专门的多视角调整才能发挥性能。

Conclusion: 该基准有效避免了微调干扰，能更真实地反映基础模型的3D理解能力，为未来3D视觉基础模型的发展提供了可靠评估工具。

Abstract: Benchmarking 3D spatial understanding of foundation models is essential for real-world applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. Existing evaluations often rely on downstream finetuning with linear heads or task-specific decoders, making it difficult to isolate the intrinsic 3D reasoning ability of pretrained encoders. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark for in-context 3D scene understanding that requires no finetuning and directly probes the quality of dense visual features. Building on the Hummingbird framework, which evaluates in-context 2D scene understanding, we extend the setup to the 3D Multi-View ImageNet (MVImgNet) dataset. Given a set of images from objects in specific angles (keys), we benchmark the performance of segmenting novel views (queries) and report the scores in 4 categories of easy, medium, hard, and extreme based on the key-query view contrast. We benchmark 8 state-of-the-art foundation models and show DINO-based encoders remain competitive across large viewpoint shifts, while 3D-aware models like VGGT require dedicated multi-view adjustments.

Method: 提出ContextSeisNet模型，采用上下文学习策略，利用同一地震测线上邻近共深度点道集及其对应标签构成的支持集来条件化预测，使模型在推理时能根据相似道集的处理示例自适应调整行为，无需重新训练。

Result: 在合成数据上，ContextSeisNet在定量指标和空间一致性方面优于U-Net；在实际数据上，其横向一致性优于传统Radon去多次波方法和U-Net，且近偏移性能更好、多次波去除更完整。此外，即使训练数据减少90%，仍能达到与U-Net相当的性能。

Conclusion: ContextSeisNet是一种实用且高效的地震去多次波方法，兼具用户可控性与空间一致性，具备推广至其他地震处理任务的潜力。

Abstract: Seismic processing transforms raw data into subsurface images essential for geophysical applications. Traditional methods face challenges, such as noisy data, and manual parameter tuning, among others. Recently deep learning approaches have proposed alternative solutions to some of these problems. However, important challenges of existing deep learning approaches are spatially inconsistent results across neighboring seismic gathers and lack of user-control. We address these limitations by introducing ContextSeisNet, an in-context learning model, to seismic demultiple processing. Our approach conditions predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs: neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows the model to learn task-specific processing behavior at inference time by observing how similar gathers should be processed, without any retraining. This method provides both flexibility through user-defined examples and improved lateral consistency across seismic lines. On synthetic data, ContextSeisNet outperforms a U-Net baseline quantitatively and demonstrates enhanced spatial coherence between neighboring gathers. On field data, our model achieves superior lateral consistency compared to both traditional Radon demultiple and the U-Net baseline. Relative to the U-Net, ContextSeisNet also delivers improved near-offset performance and more complete multiple removal. Notably, ContextSeisNet achieves comparable field data performance despite being trained on 90% less data, demonstrating substantial data efficiency. These results establish ContextSeisNet as a practical approach for spatially consistent seismic demultiple with potential applicability to other seismic processing tasks.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents adopt an end-to-end paradigm that maps a screenshot to an action sequence, thereby automating repetitive tasks in virtual environments. However, existing GUI agents are evaluated almost exclusively on commodity software such as Microsoft Word and Excel. Professional Computer-Aided Design (CAD) suites promise an order-of-magnitude higher economic return, yet remain the weakest performance domain for existing agents and are still far from replacing expert Electronic-Design-Automation (EDA) engineers. We therefore present the first systematic study that deploys GUI agents for EDA workflows. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale dataset named GUI-EDA, including 5 CAD tools and 5 physical domains, comprising 2,000+ high-quality screenshot-answer-action pairs recorded by EDA scientists and engineers during real-world component design; (2) a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates 30+ mainstream GUI agents, demonstrating that EDA tasks constitute a major, unsolved challenge; and (3) an EDA-specialized metric named EDAgent, equipped with a reflection mechanism that achieves reliable performance on industrial CAD software and, for the first time, outperforms Ph.D. students majored in Electrical Engineering. This work extends GUI agents from generic office automation to specialized, high-value engineering domains and offers a new avenue for advancing EDA productivity. The dataset will be released at: https://github.com/aiben-ch/GUI-EDA.

Abstract: Image Compression for Machines (ICM) has emerged as a pivotal research direction in the field of visual data compression. However, with the rapid evolution of machine intelligence, the target of compression has shifted from task-specific virtual models to Embodied agents operating in real-world environments. To address the communication constraints of Embodied AI in multi-agent systems and ensure real-time task execution, this paper introduces, for the first time, the scientific problem of Embodied Image Compression. We establish a standardized benchmark, EmbodiedComp, to facilitate systematic evaluation under ultra-low bitrate conditions in a closed-loop setting. Through extensive empirical studies in both simulated and real-world settings, we demonstrate that existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) fail to reliably perform even simple manipulation tasks when compressed below the Embodied bitrate threshold. We anticipate that EmbodiedComp will catalyze the development of domain-specific compression tailored for Embodied agents , thereby accelerating the Embodied AI deployment in the Real-world.

<details>

Motivation: 从稀疏或退化的2D图像中恢复高保真3D图像是医学成像中的一个基本挑战，尤其是在胎儿MRI中，需要从受运动伪影影响的低分辨率2D图像重建高分辨率3D脑图像以进行准确的神经发育诊断。现有的基于隐式神经表示（INR）的方法虽然效果好，但计算成本高昂。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于高斯基元的显式表示方法成功解决了INR在slice-to-volume重建中的计算瓶颈，为将实时胎儿3D MRI重建技术引入临床常规应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recovering high-fidelity 3D images from sparse or degraded 2D images is a fundamental challenge in medical imaging, with broad applications ranging from 3D ultrasound reconstruction to MRI super-resolution. In the context of fetal MRI, high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the brain from motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D acquisitions is a prerequisite for accurate neurodevelopmental diagnosis. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we propose a shift from neural network based implicit representations to Gaussian based explicit representations. By parameterizing the HR 3D image volume as a field of anisotropic Gaussian primitives, we leverage the property of Gaussians being closed under convolution and thus derive a \textit{closed-form analytical solution} for the forward model. This formulation reduces the previously intractable acquisition integral to an exact covariance addition ($\mathbfΣ_{obs} = \mathbfΣ_{HR} + \mathbfΣ_{PSF}$), effectively bypassing the need for compute-intensive stochastic sampling while ensuring exact gradient propagation. We demonstrate that our approach matches the reconstruction quality of self-supervised state-of-the-art SVR frameworks while delivering a 5$\times$--10$\times$ speed-up on neonatal and fetal data. With convergence often reached in under 30 seconds, our framework paves the way towards translation into clinical routine of real-time fetal 3D MRI. Code will be public at {https://github.com/m-dannecker/Gaussian-Primitives-for-Fast-SVR}.

Conclusion: FactorPortrait 能够高效地从单张肖像图像生成高质量、多视角一致且可控的肖像动画，显著提升了可控肖像动画的性能。

Abstract: We introduce FactorPortrait, a video diffusion method for controllable portrait animation that enables lifelike synthesis from disentangled control signals of facial expressions, head movement, and camera viewpoints. Given a single portrait image, a driving video, and camera trajectories, our method animates the portrait by transferring facial expressions and head movements from the driving video while simultaneously enabling novel view synthesis from arbitrary viewpoints. We utilize a pre-trained image encoder to extract facial expression latents from the driving video as control signals for animation generation. Such latents implicitly capture nuanced facial expression dynamics with identity and pose information disentangled, and they are efficiently injected into the video diffusion transformer through our proposed expression controller. For camera and head pose control, we employ Plücker ray maps and normal maps rendered from 3D body mesh tracking. To train our model, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset containing diverse combinations of camera viewpoints, head poses, and facial expression dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in realism, expressiveness, control accuracy, and view consistency.

TL;DR: 为解决基于骨架的人体活动识别（HAR）中大规模标注动作数据获取成本高的问题，作者提出KineMIC框架，通过迁移学习将通用文本到动作（T2M）生成模型适配到HAR任务，在仅使用每类10个样本的少样本设定下，显著提升动作生成质量与分类准确率（+23.1%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型标注动作数据集获取成本高，而现有Text-to-Motion（T2M）生成模型侧重艺术性而非HAR所需的运动学精确性和类别判别性，导致合成数据与HAR任务存在显著域差距。

Conclusion: KineMIC有效弥合了通用T2M模型与HAR任务之间的域差距，证明了通过语义对齐进行运动学知识蒸馏的可行性，为少样本HAR数据合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The acquisition cost for large, annotated motion datasets remains a critical bottleneck for skeletal-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Although Text-to-Motion (T2M) generative models offer a compelling, scalable source of synthetic data, their training objectives, which emphasize general artistic motion, and dataset structures fundamentally differ from HAR's requirements for kinematically precise, class-discriminative actions. This disparity creates a significant domain gap, making generalist T2M models ill-equipped for generating motions suitable for HAR classifiers. To address this challenge, we propose KineMIC (Kinetic Mining In Context), a transfer learning framework for few-shot action synthesis. KineMIC adapts a T2M diffusion model to an HAR domain by hypothesizing that semantic correspondences in the text encoding space can provide soft supervision for kinematic distillation. We operationalize this via a kinetic mining strategy that leverages CLIP text embeddings to establish correspondences between sparse HAR labels and T2M source data. This process guides fine-tuning, transforming the generalist T2M backbone into a specialized few-shot Action-to-Motion generator. We validate KineMIC using HumanML3D as the source T2M dataset and a subset of NTU RGB+D 120 as the target HAR domain, randomly selecting just 10 samples per action class. Our approach generates significantly more coherent motions, providing a robust data augmentation source that delivers a +23.1% accuracy points improvement.

Conclusion: CLV-Net通过融合视觉提示与上下文关系建模，显著提升了遥感图像中多模态理解的准确性与用户意图一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image understanding have enabled methods that leverage large language models for multimodal reasoning in remote sensing. However, existing approaches still struggle to steer models to the user-relevant regions when only simple, generic text prompts are available. Moreover, in large-scale aerial imagery many objects exhibit highly similar visual appearances and carry rich inter-object relationships, which further complicates accurate recognition. To address these challenges, we propose Cross-modal Context-aware Learning for Visual Prompt-Guided Multimodal Image Understanding (CLV-Net). CLV-Net lets users supply a simple visual cue, a bounding box, to indicate a region of interest, and uses that cue to guide the model to generate correlated segmentation masks and captions that faithfully reflect user intent. Central to our design is a Context-Aware Mask Decoder that models and integrates inter-object relationships to strengthen target representations and improve mask quality. In addition, we introduce a Semantic and Relationship Alignment module: a Cross-modal Semantic Consistency Loss enhances fine-grained discrimination among visually similar targets, while a Relationship Consistency Loss enforces alignment between textual relations and visual interactions. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that CLV-Net outperforms existing methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results. The model effectively captures user intent and produces precise, intention-aligned multimodal outputs.

Conclusion: Depth Copy Paste通过融合多模态信息与深度感知策略，有效提升了人脸检测系统在挑战性条件下的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Data augmentation is crucial for improving the robustness of face detection systems, especially under challenging conditions such as occlusion, illumination variation, and complex environments. Traditional copy paste augmentation often produces unrealistic composites due to inaccurate foreground extraction, inconsistent scene geometry, and mismatched background semantics. To address these limitations, we propose Depth Copy Paste, a multimodal and depth aware augmentation framework that generates diverse and physically consistent face detection training samples by copying full body person instances and pasting them into semantically compatible scenes. Our approach first employs BLIP and CLIP to jointly assess semantic and visual coherence, enabling automatic retrieval of the most suitable background images for the given foreground person. To ensure high quality foreground masks that preserve facial details, we integrate SAM3 for precise segmentation and Depth-Anything to extract only the non occluded visible person regions, preventing corrupted facial textures from being used in augmentation. For geometric realism, we introduce a depth guided sliding window placement mechanism that searches over the background depth map to identify paste locations with optimal depth continuity and scale alignment. The resulting composites exhibit natural depth relationships and improved visual plausibility. Extensive experiments show that Depth Copy Paste provides more diverse and realistic training data, leading to significant performance improvements in downstream face detection tasks compared with traditional copy paste and depth free augmentation methods.

Conclusion: 所提出的文本图像分类设备在复杂环境下具有良好的鲁棒性和实用性，适用于多源混合文本图像的自动分类任务。

Abstract: This is to present a text image classifier device that identifies textual content in images and then categorizes each image into one of four predefined categories, including Invoice, Form, Letter, or Report. The device supports a gallery mode, in which users browse files on flash disks, hard disk drives, or microSD cards, and a live mode which renders feeds of cameras connected to it. Its design is specifically aimed at addressing pragmatic challenges, such as changing light, random orientation, curvature or partial coverage of text, low resolution, and slightly visible text. The steps of the processing process are divided into four steps: image acquisition and preprocessing, textual elements detection with the help of DBNet++ (Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) model, BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformers) model that classifies detected textual elements, and the presentation of the results through a user interface written in Python and PyQt5. All the stages are connected in such a way that they form a smooth workflow. The system achieved a text recognition rate of about 94.62% when tested over ten hours on the mentioned Total-Text dataset, that includes high resolution images, created so as to represent a wide range of problematic conditions. These experimental results support the effectiveness of the suggested methodology to practice, mixed-source text categorization, even in uncontrolled imaging conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出EditMGT，首个基于Masked Generative Transformers（MGT）的图像编辑框架，通过利用MGT的局部解码特性与注意力机制实现精准区域编辑，在保持非目标区域不变的同时显著提升编辑速度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（DMs）在图像编辑中因全局去噪机制易导致非目标区域被意外修改；为解决此问题，作者转向具有局部生成能力的Masked Generative Transformers（MGTs），以实现更精确的区域编辑控制。

Method: 提出EditMGT框架：1）利用MGT的交叉注意力图定位编辑区域，并设计多层注意力融合策略提升定位精度；2）引入区域保持采样（region-hold sampling）机制，限制低注意力区域的token更新以防止无关编辑；3）构建高质量数据集CrispEdit-2M，并通过注意力注入将预训练文本到图像MGT适配为编辑模型，无需新增参数。

Result: 在四个标准基准上实验表明，EditMGT在参数量小于1B的情况下，编辑速度提升6倍，同时在风格变换和风格迁移任务上分别提升3.6%和17.6%的编辑质量，且整体效果与现有方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: MGT因其固有的局部生成机制，天然适合高保真、高效率的图像编辑任务；所提出的EditMGT框架有效解决了扩散模型中的非目标区域干扰问题，为未来图像编辑提供了一种高效且精准的新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) have achieved exceptional visual quality in image editing tasks. However, the global denoising dynamics of DMs inherently conflate local editing targets with the full-image context, leading to unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we shift our attention beyond DMs and turn to Masked Generative Transformers (MGTs) as an alternative approach to tackle this challenge. By predicting multiple masked tokens rather than holistic refinement, MGTs exhibit a localized decoding paradigm that endows them with the inherent capacity to explicitly preserve non-relevant regions during the editing process. Building upon this insight, we introduce the first MGT-based image editing framework, termed EditMGT. We first demonstrate that MGT's cross-attention maps provide informative localization signals for localizing edit-relevant regions and devise a multi-layer attention consolidation scheme that refines these maps to achieve fine-grained and precise localization. On top of these adaptive localization results, we introduce region-hold sampling, which restricts token flipping within low-attention areas to suppress spurious edits, thereby confining modifications to the intended target regions and preserving the integrity of surrounding non-target areas. To train EditMGT, we construct CrispEdit-2M, a high-resolution dataset spanning seven diverse editing categories. Without introducing additional parameters, we adapt a pre-trained text-to-image MGT into an image editing model through attention injection. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks demonstrate that, with fewer than 1B parameters, our model achieves similarity performance while enabling 6 times faster editing. Moreover, it delivers comparable or superior editing quality, with improvements of 3.6% and 17.6% on style change and style transfer tasks, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱到强泛化的全自动训练方法，用于多头Mask-RCNN模型，在无需人工标注的情况下实现对新型多重循环免疫荧光全切片图像中重叠细胞核的可靠分割，并引入自动分割质量诊断指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多重循环免疫荧光全切片图像（WSI）中，重叠细胞核的分割具有挑战性，且人工标注成本高昂；现有方法难以适应新仪器或新成像协议下的图像，亟需一种无需人工标注即可泛化至新图像类别的自动化分割方法。

Method: 采用带有高效通道注意力机制的多头Mask-RCNN架构，结合弱到强泛化策略，通过伪标签校正和覆盖扩展实现全自动训练；同时设计了用于生产环境中自动评估分割质量的指标。

Result: 在与五种主流方法的对比中表现显著优越，能够无需人工标注地泛化至来自新仪器或新成像协议的新图像类别，并提供开源代码、样本图像及高分辨率分割结果。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了WSI中重叠细胞核分割的泛化难题，具备良好的自动化能力与实用性，适用于大规模病理图像分析场景。

Abstract: We present a weak to strong generalization methodology for fully automated training of a multi-head extension of the Mask-RCNN method with efficient channel attention for reliable segmentation of overlapping cell nuclei in multiplex cyclic immunofluorescent (IF) whole-slide images (WSI), and present evidence for pseudo-label correction and coverage expansion, the key phenomena underlying weak to strong generalization. This method can learn to segment de novo a new class of images from a new instrument and/or a new imaging protocol without the need for human annotations. We also present metrics for automated self-diagnosis of segmentation quality in production environments, where human visual proofreading of massive WSI images is unaffordable. Our method was benchmarked against five current widely used methods and showed a significant improvement. The code, sample WSI images, and high-resolution segmentation results are provided in open form for community adoption and adaptation.

TL;DR: 本文提出SVG-T2I，一种在视觉基础模型（VFM）表示空间中直接进行高质量文本到图像生成的扩散模型，验证了VFM在生成任务中的强大表征能力，并开源了相关模型与代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于视觉基础模型（VFM）表示的视觉生成具有整合理解、感知与生成的潜力，但目前在VFM表示空间内训练大规模文本到图像扩散模型的研究仍十分有限。

Method: 作者扩展了SVG框架，提出SVG-T2I，在VFM特征域中利用标准文本到图像扩散流程进行训练和生成。

Result: SVG-T2I在GenEval上达到0.75，在DPG-Bench上达到85.78，展现出与现有方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 研究验证了VFM表征在生成任务中的内在能力，并通过全面开源促进表征驱动的视觉生成研究。

Abstract: Visual generation grounded in Visual Foundation Model (VFM) representations offers a highly promising unified pathway for integrating visual understanding, perception, and generation. Despite this potential, training large-scale text-to-image diffusion models entirely within the VFM representation space remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we scale the SVG (Self-supervised representations for Visual Generation) framework, proposing SVG-T2I to support high-quality text-to-image synthesis directly in the VFM feature domain. By leveraging a standard text-to-image diffusion pipeline, SVG-T2I achieves competitive performance, reaching 0.75 on GenEval and 85.78 on DPG-Bench. This performance validates the intrinsic representational power of VFMs for generative tasks. We fully open-source the project, including the autoencoder and generation model, together with their training, inference, evaluation pipelines, and pre-trained weights, to facilitate further research in representation-driven visual generation.

*Mohammad Dehghanmanshadi,Wallapak Tavanapong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文将基于反演的风格迁移（InST）框架应用于生物显微图像，通过结合自适应实例归一化与扩散模型中的随机反演，将真实荧光显微图像的风格迁移到合成图像上，在弱保留内容结构的同时显著提升细胞计数任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标签稀缺的场景（如高密度细胞图像）中，生成逼真的合成显微图像对训练深度学习模型至关重要；然而传统域自适应方法难以弥合合成图像与真实样本在复杂纹理和视觉模式上的域差距。

Method: 采用InST框架，结合潜在空间的自适应实例归一化（AdaIN）与扩散模型中的随机反演，将真实荧光显微图像的风格迁移到硬编码合成图像上，同时弱保留其内容结构。

Result: 使用InST合成数据预训练的EfficientNet-B0模型在细胞计数任务中表现优异：相比硬编码合成数据MAE降低37%，相比Cell200-s数据集降低52%（从53.70降至25.95），甚至优于仅用真实数据训练的模型（25.95 vs. 27.74 MAE）；结合DACS+CutMix等轻量域自适应技术可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: InST风格迁移能有效缩小合成与真实显微图像之间的域差距，为减少人工标注、提升细胞计数性能提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic microscopy images is critical for training deep learning models in label-scarce environments, such as cell counting with many cells per image. However, traditional domain adaptation methods often struggle to bridge the domain gap when synthetic images lack the complex textures and visual patterns of real samples. In this work, we adapt the Inversion-Based Style Transfer (InST) framework originally designed for artistic style transfer to biomedical microscopy images. Our method combines latent-space Adaptive Instance Normalization with stochastic inversion in a diffusion model to transfer the style from real fluorescence microscopy images to synthetic ones, while weakly preserving content structure.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our InST-based synthetic dataset for downstream cell counting by pre-training and fine-tuning EfficientNet-B0 models on various data sources, including real data, hard-coded synthetic data, and the public Cell200-s dataset. Models trained with our InST-synthesized images achieve up to 37\% lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to models trained on hard-coded synthetic data, and a 52\% reduction in MAE compared to models trained on Cell200-s (from 53.70 to 25.95 MAE). Notably, our approach also outperforms models trained on real data alone (25.95 vs. 27.74 MAE). Further improvements are achieved when combining InST-synthesized data with lightweight domain adaptation techniques such as DACS with CutMix. These findings demonstrate that InST-based style transfer most effectively reduces the domain gap between synthetic and real microscopy data. Our approach offers a scalable path for enhancing cell counting performance while minimizing manual labeling effort.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频抠图方法受限于数据集规模和真实性，且缺乏有效的边界监督，导致生成的 alpha 遮罩缺乏精细细节；同时，如何在无真值情况下评估和提升抠图质量也是一个关键挑战。

Method: 提出 Matting Quality Evaluator (MQE)，可无监督地生成像素级质量评估图；MQE 既可用于训练中作为在线反馈抑制错误区域，也可用于离线数据筛选以构建高质量数据集 VMReal；此外引入参考帧训练策略，融合长距离帧信息以提升长视频处理能力。

Result: 构建了包含28K视频片段和2.4M帧的大规模真实视频抠图数据集 VMReal；所提 MatAnyone 2 模型在合成与真实世界基准测试中均取得最优性能，全面超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入无监督质量评估机制与新型训练策略，有效解决了视频抠图中边界细节缺失与数据不足的问题，显著提升了模型在真实场景下的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Video matting remains limited by the scale and realism of existing datasets. While leveraging segmentation data can enhance semantic stability, the lack of effective boundary supervision often leads to segmentation-like mattes lacking fine details. To this end, we introduce a learned Matting Quality Evaluator (MQE) that assesses semantic and boundary quality of alpha mattes without ground truth. It produces a pixel-wise evaluation map that identifies reliable and erroneous regions, enabling fine-grained quality assessment. The MQE scales up video matting in two ways: (1) as an online matting-quality feedback during training to suppress erroneous regions, providing comprehensive supervision, and (2) as an offline selection module for data curation, improving annotation quality by combining the strengths of leading video and image matting models. This process allows us to build a large-scale real-world video matting dataset, VMReal, containing 28K clips and 2.4M frames. To handle large appearance variations in long videos, we introduce a reference-frame training strategy that incorporates long-range frames beyond the local window for effective training. Our MatAnyone 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior methods across all metrics.

Motivation: 准确量化常规临床照片中的白癜风病灶范围对治疗反应的纵向监测至关重要，但现有方法在边界精度和可靠性方面存在不足。

Method: 该方法包含三个核心部分：(1) 结合ISIC 2019数据集领域自适应预训练与ROI约束双任务损失的数据高效训练策略；(2) 基于ConvNeXt V2编码器并引入高频谱门控（HFSG）模块与stem-skip连接的架构改进；(3) 利用K折集成与测试时增强（TTA）生成像素级不确定性图的临床可信机制。

Result: 在专家标注的临床队列上验证，Dice得分为85.05%，95% Hausdorff距离从44.79像素降至29.95像素，优于ResNet-50、UNet++和MiT-B5等强基线模型，且无灾难性失败，同时提供可解释的熵图以辅助医生复核不确定区域。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架为自动化白癜风评估建立了一个鲁棒且可靠的标准化方法，具备良好的临床应用前景。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying vitiligo extent in routine clinical photographs is crucial for longitudinal monitoring of treatment response. We propose a trustworthy, frequency-aware segmentation framework built on three synergistic pillars: (1) a data-efficient training strategy combining domain-adaptive pre-training on the ISIC 2019 dataset with an ROI-constrained dual-task loss to suppress background noise; (2) an architectural refinement via a ConvNeXt V2-based encoder enhanced with a novel High-Frequency Spectral Gating (HFSG) module and stem-skip connections to capture subtle textures; and (3) a clinical trust mechanism employing K-fold ensemble and Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) to generate pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Extensive validation on an expert-annotated clinical cohort demonstrates superior performance, achieving a Dice score of 85.05% and significantly reducing boundary error (95% Hausdorff Distance improved from 44.79 px to 29.95 px), consistently outperforming strong CNN (ResNet-50 and UNet++) and Transformer (MiT-B5) baselines. Notably, our framework demonstrates high reliability with zero catastrophic failures and provides interpretable entropy maps to identify ambiguous regions for clinician review. Our approach suggests that the proposed framework establishes a robust and reliable standard for automated vitiligo assessment.

TL;DR: 本文提出SAM2VideoX，通过将自回归视频追踪模型（SAM2）中的结构保持运动先验蒸馏到双向视频扩散模型（CogVideoX）中，显著提升了生成视频的结构一致性和运动真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成扩散模型在生成具有真实结构保持性的运动方面仍存在挑战，尤其对于人体和动物等可变形或有关节的对象。单纯扩大训练数据无法解决物理上不合理的过渡问题，而现有方法依赖于噪声较大的运动表示（如光流或外部模型提取的骨架），效果受限。

Method: 作者提出一种新方法，将SAM2中的结构保持运动先验蒸馏到CogVideoX中，具体包括：(1) 双向特征融合模块，从SAM2中提取全局结构保持运动先验；(2) 局部Gram流损失函数，对齐局部特征的运动方式。

Result: 在VBench和人类评估中，SAM2VideoX显著优于现有基线：VBench得分提升2.60%（达95.51%），FVD降低21-22%，人类偏好率达71.4%。

Conclusion: 通过结合自回归追踪模型的结构先验与扩散模型的生成能力，SAM2VideoX有效提升了视频生成中运动的真实性和结构一致性，为高质量视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reality is a dance between rigid constraints and deformable structures. For video models, that means generating motion that preserves fidelity as well as structure. Despite progress in diffusion models, producing realistic structure-preserving motion remains challenging, especially for articulated and deformable objects such as humans and animals. Scaling training data alone, so far, has failed to resolve physically implausible transitions. Existing approaches rely on conditioning with noisy motion representations, such as optical flow or skeletons extracted using an external imperfect model. To address these challenges, we introduce an algorithm to distill structure-preserving motion priors from an autoregressive video tracking model (SAM2) into a bidirectional video diffusion model (CogVideoX). With our method, we train SAM2VideoX, which contains two innovations: (1) a bidirectional feature fusion module that extracts global structure-preserving motion priors from a recurrent model like SAM2; (2) a Local Gram Flow loss that aligns how local features move together. Experiments on VBench and in human studies show that SAM2VideoX delivers consistent gains (+2.60\% on VBench, 21-22\% lower FVD, and 71.4\% human preference) over prior baselines. Specifically, on VBench, we achieve 95.51\%, surpassing REPA (92.91\%) by 2.60\%, and reduce FVD to 360.57, a 21.20\% and 22.46\% improvement over REPA- and LoRA-finetuning, respectively.

TL;DR: V-RGBX 是首个端到端的内蕴感知视频编辑框架，能够联合实现视频逆渲染、基于内蕴表示的逼真视频合成以及基于关键帧的内蕴条件编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模视频生成模型虽能模拟真实场景中的外观与光照交互，但缺乏一个闭环框架来联合理解内蕴场景属性（如反照率、法线、材质和辐照度）、利用这些属性进行视频合成，并支持可编辑的内蕴表示。

Method: V-RGBX 采用交错条件机制，统一实现三大功能：(1) 视频逆渲染为内蕴通道；(2) 从内蕴表示生成逼真视频；(3) 基于用户选定关键帧并以内蕴通道为条件进行视频编辑。

Result: 实验表明 V-RGBX 能生成时序一致、逼真的视频，并以物理合理的方式将关键帧编辑传播至整个序列，在物体外观编辑和场景级重光照等任务中优于先前方法。

Conclusion: V-RGBX 成功实现了内蕴感知的端到端视频编辑，为物理驱动、可编辑的视频生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have shown remarkable potential in modeling photorealistic appearance and lighting interactions in real-world scenes. However, a closed-loop framework that jointly understands intrinsic scene properties (e.g., albedo, normal, material, and irradiance), leverages them for video synthesis, and supports editable intrinsic representations remains unexplored. We present V-RGBX, the first end-to-end framework for intrinsic-aware video editing. V-RGBX unifies three key capabilities: (1) video inverse rendering into intrinsic channels, (2) photorealistic video synthesis from these intrinsic representations, and (3) keyframe-based video editing conditioned on intrinsic channels. At the core of V-RGBX is an interleaved conditioning mechanism that enables intuitive, physically grounded video editing through user-selected keyframes, supporting flexible manipulation of any intrinsic modality. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that V-RGBX produces temporally consistent, photorealistic videos while propagating keyframe edits across sequences in a physically plausible manner. We demonstrate its effectiveness in diverse applications, including object appearance editing and scene-level relighting, surpassing the performance of prior methods.

Motivation: 现有3D高斯点阵（3DGS）方法依赖简化的alpha混合和粗略的密度积分近似，难以准确渲染具有复杂重叠的半透明物体。

Method: 借鉴基于矩的顺序无关透明技术，通过分析推导每个像素上所有相关3D高斯分布的统计矩，构建沿相机光线的连续透射函数，并在每个高斯内部独立采样。

Result: 该方法显著提升了对复杂半透明介质中光衰减的建模能力，在保持光栅化效率的同时大幅改善了重建与渲染质量。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效弥合了光栅化渲染与物理准确性之间的差距，为3D高斯表示提供了高保真透射率计算的新途径。

Abstract: The recent success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has reshaped novel view synthesis by enabling fast optimization and real-time rendering of high-quality radiance fields. However, it relies on simplified, order-dependent alpha blending and coarse approximations of the density integral within the rasterizer, thereby limiting its ability to render complex, overlapping semi-transparent objects. In this paper, we extend rasterization-based rendering of 3D Gaussian representations with a novel method for high-fidelity transmittance computation, entirely avoiding the need for ray tracing or per-pixel sample sorting. Building on prior work in moment-based order-independent transparency, our key idea is to characterize the density distribution along each camera ray with a compact and continuous representation based on statistical moments. To this end, we analytically derive and compute a set of per-pixel moments from all contributing 3D Gaussians. From these moments, a continuous transmittance function is reconstructed for each ray, which is then independently sampled within each Gaussian. As a result, our method bridges the gap between rasterization and physical accuracy by modeling light attenuation in complex translucent media, significantly improving overall reconstruction and rendering quality.

Motivation: 解决凸多面体表面上两点间最短路径查询问题，旨在降低已有方法中过高的预处理时间和空间复杂度，提升算法效率。

Method: 设计新的数据结构以支持高效查询，并针对特殊情形（一个查询点位于边上）优化预处理；同时开发新算法来计算所有最短路径边序列。

Result: 将一般情形下的预处理复杂度从 $O(n^{8+\varepsilon})$ 降至 $O(n^{6+\varepsilon})$，特殊情形下进一步降至 $O(n^{5+\varepsilon})$，且均保持 $O(\log n)$ 查询时间；最短路径边序列的计算时间从 $O(n^6\log n\log^*n)$ 改进至 $O(n^{5+\varepsilon})$。

Conclusion: 本文显著改进了凸多面体表面最短路径查询问题的预处理效率和边序列计算算法，在理论复杂度上取得重要进展。

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the surface of a convex polyhedron with $n$ vertices. We consider the two-point shortest path query problem for $\mathcal{P}$: Constructing a data structure so that given any two query points $s$ and $t$ on $\mathcal{P}$, a shortest path from $s$ to $t$ on $\mathcal{P}$ can be computed efficiently. To achieve $O(\log n)$ query time (for computing the shortest path length), the previously best result uses $O(n^{8+ε})$ preprocessing time and space [Aggarwal, Aronov, O'Rourke, and Schevon, SICOMP 1997], where $ε$ is an arbitrarily small positive constant. In this paper, we present a new data structure of $O(n^{6+ε})$ preprocessing time and space, with $O(\log n)$ query time. For a special case where one query point is required to lie on one of the edges of $\mathcal{P}$, the previously best work uses $O(n^{6+ε})$ preprocessing time and space to achieve $O(\log n)$ query time. We improve the preprocessing time and space to $O(n^{5+ε})$, with $O(\log n)$ query time. Furthermore, we present a new algorithm to compute the exact set of shortest path edge sequences of $\mathcal{P}$, which are known to be $Θ(n^4)$ in number and have a total complexity of $Θ(n^5)$ in the worst case. The previously best algorithm for the problem takes roughly $O(n^6\log n\log^*n)$ time, while our new algorithm runs in $O(n^{5+ε})$ time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合引理在处理多个排列叠加中面的复杂度时存在局限，作者旨在通过扩展该引理，更精确地刻画复杂度与排列数量、面数量及其在各单独排列中复杂度之间的关系，并推动其在计算几何中的应用。

Abstract: We present an extension of the Combination Lemma of [GSS89] that expresses the complexity of one or several faces in the overlay of many arrangements, as a function of the number of arrangements, the number of faces, and the complexities of these faces in the separate arrangements. Several applications of the new Combination Lemma are presented: We first show that the complexity of a single face in an arrangement of $k$ simple polygons with a total of $n$ sides is $Θ(n α(k) )$, where $α(\cdot)$ is the inverse of Ackermann's function. We also give a new and simpler proof of the bound $O \left( \sqrt{m} λ_{s+2}( n ) \right)$ on the total number of edges of $m$ faces in an arrangement of $n$ Jordan arcs, each pair of which intersect in at most $s$ points, where $λ_{s}(n)$ is the maximum length of a Davenport-Schinzel sequence of order $s$ with $n$ symbols. We extend this result, showing that the total number of edges of $m$ faces in a sparse arrangement of $n$ Jordan arcs is $O \left( (n + \sqrt{m}\sqrt{w}) \frac{λ_{s+2}(n)}{n} \right)$, where $w$ is the total complexity of the arrangement. Several other applications and variants of the Combination Lemma are also presented.

### [76] [FutureWeaver: Planning Test-Time Compute for Multi-Agent Systems with Modularized Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11213)
*Dongwon Jung,Peng Shi,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FutureWeaver 是一个在固定计算预算下优化多智能体系统推理时计算分配的框架，通过模块化协作和双层规划架构提升多智能体协作性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时计算扩展方法难以应用于多智能体系统，缺乏在预算约束下协调多个智能体进行协作的机制。

Method: 提出 FutureWeaver 框架，通过自博弈反思自动提取可复用的多智能体工作流模块，并采用双层规划架构，在当前任务状态和未来步骤上联合优化计算资源分配。

Result: 在多个复杂智能体基准测试中，FutureWeaver 在不同预算设置下均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FutureWeaver 有效实现了多智能体系统中推理时计算资源的优化分配，显著提升了协作任务的成功率。

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves large language model performance without additional training. Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization.

### [77] [TriFlow: A Progressive Multi-Agent Framework for Intelligent Trip Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11271)
*Yuxing Chen,Basem Suleiman,Qifan Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TriFlow 是一个三阶段多智能体框架，通过检索、规划与治理协同，在满足时空与预算约束的同时高效生成个性化行程，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的行程规划需在严格约束下将开放性用户请求转化为可行方案，而现有基于大语言模型的智能体在约束满足、工具协调和效率方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出 TriFlow 框架，采用检索、规划和治理三阶段流水线，结合规则与大语言模型协作，逐步缩小搜索空间并进行有界迭代优化。

Result: 在 TravelPlanner 和 TripTailor 基准上分别达到 91.1% 和 97% 的最终通过率，运行效率较当前最优方法提升超过 10 倍。

Conclusion: TriFlow 有效解决了现有方法在行程规划中约束满足与效率不足的问题，实现了高可行性、个性化与高效性的统一。

Abstract: Real-world trip planning requires transforming open-ended user requests into executable itineraries under strict spatial, temporal, and budgetary constraints while aligning with user preferences. Existing LLM-based agents struggle with constraint satisfaction, tool coordination, and efficiency, often producing infeasible or costly plans. To address these limitations, we present TriFlow, a progressive multi-agent framework that unifies structured reasoning and language-based flexibility through a three-stage pipeline of retrieval, planning, and governance. By this design, TriFlow progressively narrows the search space, assembles constraint-consistent itineraries via rule-LLM collaboration, and performs bounded iterative refinement to ensure global feasibility and personalisation. Evaluations on TravelPlanner and TripTailor benchmarks demonstrated state-of-the-art results, achieving 91.1% and 97% final pass rates, respectively, with over 10x runtime efficiency improvement compared to current SOTA.

### [78] [CAPTURE: A Benchmark and Evaluation for LVLMs in CAPTCHA Resolving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11323)
*Jianyi Zhang,Ziyin Zhou,Xu Ji,Shizhao Liu,Zhangchi Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文首次提出了面向大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的新型验证码（CAPTCHA）评测基准CAPTURE，涵盖4类25种子类型、来自31家供应商的大规模多样化数据，并配有专为LVLM设计的标签。实验表明，现有LVLM在该基准上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉验证码的评测基准存在覆盖不全、缺乏针对LVLM专用设计的问题，难以全面评估LVLM在真实场景下的验证码识别能力。

Method: 构建名为CAPTURE的新基准，整合4种主要验证码类型和25种子类型，采集自31家供应商，提供大规模、高多样性数据及LVLM定制化标签。

Result: 当前LVLM在CAPTURE基准上的验证码解题性能较差，揭示了其在实际应用中的局限性。

Conclusion: CAPTURE填补了LVLM验证码评测领域在数据全面性和标签相关性方面的空白，为未来模型改进提供了可靠评估工具。

Abstract: Benefiting from strong and efficient multi-modal alignment strategies, Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) are able to simulate human visual and reasoning capabilities, such as solving CAPTCHAs. However, existing benchmarks based on visual CAPTCHAs still face limitations. Previous studies, when designing benchmarks and datasets, customized them according to their research objectives. Consequently, these benchmarks cannot comprehensively cover all CAPTCHA types. Notably, there is a dearth of dedicated benchmarks for LVLMs. To address this problem, we introduce a novel CAPTCHA benchmark for the first time, named CAPTURE CAPTCHA for Testing Under Real-world Experiments, specifically for LVLMs. Our benchmark encompasses 4 main CAPTCHA types and 25 sub-types from 31 vendors. The diversity enables a multi-dimensional and thorough evaluation of LVLM performance. CAPTURE features extensive class variety, large-scale data, and unique LVLM-tailored labels, filling the gaps in previous research in terms of data comprehensiveness and labeling pertinence. When evaluated by this benchmark, current LVLMs demonstrate poor performance in solving CAPTCHAs.

### [79] [Towards Trustworthy Multi-Turn LLM Agents via Behavioral Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11421)
*Gonca Gürsun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种任务完成框架，通过结合轻量级任务分析器、可验证的推理模块和约束合规的生成模块，使大语言模型在多轮任务中表现出可靠且可验证的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多轮任务中的行为缺乏可靠性和可验证性，亟需一种能在强化学习形式化环境中提供明确行为指导的框架。

Method: 该框架包含三个组件：轻量级任务分析器用于选择推理与生成策略；推理模块学习可验证的观察-动作映射；生成模块通过验证或确定性合成确保输出符合约束。三者在智能体与环境交互过程中协同演化。

Result: 实验表明，随着智能体与环境的持续交互，所提框架能有效提升其行为的可信度和一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功增强了大语言模型在多轮任务中的可靠性与可验证性，为构建值得信赖的智能体提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong reasoning and generation abilities, yet their behavior in multi-turn tasks often lacks reliability and verifiability. We present a task completion framework that enables LLM-based agents to act under explicit behavioral guidance in environments described by reinforcement learning formalisms with defined observation, action, and reward signals.
  The framework integrates three components: a lightweight task profiler that selects reasoning and generation strategies, a reasoning module that learns verifiable observation - action mappings, and a generation module that enforces constraint-compliant outputs through validation or deterministic synthesis. We show that as the agent interacts with the environment, these components co-evolve, yielding trustworthy behavior.

### [80] [AgentBalance: Backbone-then-Topology Design for Cost-Effective Multi-Agent Systems under Budget Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11426)
*Shuowei Cai,Yansong Ning,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了AgentBalance框架，通过“先骨干模型后拓扑结构”的设计，在显式的token成本和延迟预算约束下构建高性价比的多智能体系统（MAS），在多个基准上显著提升性能并具备良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的多智能体系统在提升成本效益时，通常未显式建模和优化实际部署中的token成本与延迟预算，导致在预算受限时性能次优。

Method: AgentBalance采用两阶段方法：首先进行以骨干模型为导向的智能体生成（包括LLM池构建、选择及角色-骨干匹配），然后进行自适应拓扑生成（通过智能体表征学习、门控机制和延迟感知的拓扑合成）。

Result: 在包含14个候选LLM骨干的基准测试中，AgentBalance在相同token成本和延迟预算下分别最多提升10%和22%的性能，在性能-预算曲线上表现优异，并可作为插件提升现有MAS的性能，且能泛化至未见过的LLM。

Conclusion: AgentBalance有效解决了预算约束下多智能体系统的成本效益优化问题，具有实用性和可扩展性，适用于真实场景的大规模部署。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) are becoming indispensable building blocks for web-scale applications such as web search, social network analytics, and online customer support, where cost-effectiveness is increasingly the primary constraint for large-scale deployment. While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

### [81] [Back to the Baseline: Examining Baseline Effects on Explainability Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11433)
*Agustin Martin Picard,Thibaut Boissin,Varshini Subhash,Rémi Cadène,Thomas Fel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文指出在可解释人工智能（XAI）中常用的保真度指标（如Insertion和Deletion）因依赖基线函数而存在偏差，不同基线会偏好不同的归因方法，甚至导致简单线性模型自相矛盾。作者提出理想基线应满足两个性质：移除信息且不产生过度分布外（OOD）的图像，并发现现有基线无法同时满足这两点。为此，他们利用特征可视化技术提出一种新的模型依赖型基线，在保留信息移除能力的同时减少OOD问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用于评估归因方法的保真度指标（如Insertion/Deletion）严重依赖所选基线，而基线的选择会不公平地偏向某些归因方法，甚至导致评估结果自相矛盾，因此需要重新审视并改进基线设计。

Method: 作者分析了现有基线在“移除信息”和“避免生成OOD图像”两个理想属性上的表现，并基于特征可视化技术构建了一种新的模型依赖型基线，以更好地平衡这两个目标。

Result: 实验表明，现有基线无法同时满足移除信息和避免OOD图像的要求，而所提出的新基线在两者之间取得了更好的权衡，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 归因方法的评估应更加关注基线选择的影响；通过引入基于特征可视化的新型基线，可以在保持信息移除效果的同时减少分布偏移，从而提升评估的公平性与可靠性。

Abstract: Attribution methods are among the most prevalent techniques in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and are usually evaluated and compared using Fidelity metrics, with Insertion and Deletion being the most popular. These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/deel-ai-papers/Back-to-the-Baseline

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning 是一个12.7B参数的开源语言模型，通过系统、数据和算法层面的综合优化，在复杂推理和长上下文理解方面达到接近更大规模闭源模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源模型在复杂推理和长上下文任务上与前沿闭源模型存在显著差距，且在推理能力微调过程中常面临模型崩溃和训练不稳定等问题。

Method: 提出一套可复现的训练方案，包括：基于混合并行和内核优化的64K上下文高效内存基础设施；两阶段监督微调（SFT）课程，使用经过验证的对齐合成数据缓解分布不匹配；以及结合难度感知数据过滤和混合策略轨迹复用的强化学习微调（RLFT）流程以稳定训练。

Result: 在数学、编程和智能体基准测试中，该模型性能媲美参数量显著更大的模型。

Conclusion: Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning 为社区提供了一个具有竞争力的开源模型，并为在现实计算资源限制下扩展模型推理能力提供了实用蓝图。

Abstract: We introduce Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning, a 12.7B parameter language model designed to bridge the gap between open-weight systems and proprietary frontier models in complex reasoning and long-context understanding. Addressing the common challenges of model collapse and training instability in reasoning adaptation, we propose a comprehensive, reproducible training recipe spanning system, data, and algorithmic optimizations. Our approach combines memory-efficient infrastructure for 64K-token contexts using hybrid parallelism and kernel-level optimizations with a two-stage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that mitigates distribution mismatch through verified, aligned synthetic data. Furthermore, we detail a robust Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) pipeline that stabilizes training via difficulty-aware data filtering and mixed-policy trajectory reuse. Empirical results demonstrate that Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning achieves performance comparable to models with significantly larger parameter counts across mathematics, coding, and agentic benchmarks, offering the community a competitive open model and a practical blueprint for scaling reasoning capabilities under realistic compute constraints.

*Pranav Ramanathan,Thomas Prellberg,Matthew Lewis,Prathamesh Dinesh Joshi,Raj Abhijit Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文首次系统比较了经典优化方法（如整数线性规划）与人工智能方法（如PatternBoost和PPO强化学习）在解决No-Three-In-Line问题上的表现，发现经典方法在小规模网格上仍能保证最优解，而AI方法在较小实例上具有竞争力，混合策略是未来扩展至更大规模的关键方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No-Three-In-Line问题是组合几何中的著名难题，传统方法如整数线性规划虽能保证最优但计算复杂度高，而机器学习提供了基于模式识别的新思路，因此有必要系统评估两类方法的性能差异与互补潜力。

Method: 作者将PatternBoost Transformer学习和近端策略优化（PPO）强化学习首次应用于该问题，并与整数线性规划（ILP）进行对比实验，在不同大小的网格上评估其求解质量与可扩展性。

Result: ILP在19×19以内网格可获得最优解；PatternBoost在14×14以内匹配最优解且测试损失降低96%；PPO在10×10网格上表现完美，但在11×11时因违反约束而失败。

Conclusion: 经典优化方法对精确求解仍不可或缺，AI方法在小规模问题上表现良好，而结合两者优势的混合方法最有希望应对更大规模的No-Three-In-Line问题。

Abstract: The No-Three-In-Line problem asks for the maximum number of points that can be placed on an n by n grid with no three collinear, representing a famous problem in combinatorial geometry. While classical methods like Integer Linear Programming (ILP) guarantee optimal solutions, they face exponential scaling with grid size, and recent advances in machine learning offer promising alternatives for pattern-based approximation. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction. PPO achieves perfect solutions on 10 by 10 grids but fails at 11 by 11 grids, where constraint violations prevent valid configurations. These results demonstrate that classical optimization remains essential for exact solutions while AI methods offer competitive performance on smaller instances, with hybrid approaches presenting the most promising direction for scaling to larger problem sizes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了BAID框架，用于系统评估AI生成文本检测器在多种社会语言因素下的偏见问题，发现现有检测器对弱势群体文本存在显著识别偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI文本检测器在教育和专业场景中被广泛采用，但缺乏对其在更广泛社会语言因素下偏见的系统性评估，尤其对英语学习者等群体可能存在不公平影响。

Method: 作者构建了包含20万多个样本的评测数据集，覆盖人口统计、年龄、教育水平、方言、正式程度、政治倾向和主题七大类别，并为每个样本生成保留原意但体现子群体写作风格的合成版本，用以评估四个开源先进AI检测器的表现。

Result: 评估结果显示，这些检测器在不同群体间存在持续性的性能差异，尤其对代表性不足群体的文本召回率较低。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种可扩展且透明的AI检测器偏见审计方法，强调在部署前需进行偏见感知的全面评估。

Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have recently gained adoption in educational and professional contexts. Prior research has uncovered isolated cases of bias, particularly against English Language Learners (ELLs) however, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of such systems across broader sociolinguistic factors. In this work, we propose BAID, a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI detectors across various types of biases. As a part of the framework, we introduce over 200k samples spanning 7 major categories: demographics, age, educational grade level, dialect, formality, political leaning, and topic. We also generated synthetic versions of each sample with carefully crafted prompts to preserve the original content while reflecting subgroup-specific writing styles. Using this, we evaluate four open-source state-of-the-art AI text detectors and find consistent disparities in detection performance, particularly low recall rates for texts from underrepresented groups. Our contributions provide a scalable, transparent approach for auditing AI detectors and emphasize the need for bias-aware evaluation before these tools are deployed for public use.

TL;DR: 本研究通过模拟真实临床场景，评估主流大语言模型（LLMs）在处理含噪声和冗余信息的患者主诉时提取核心医疗信息的能力，首次提出“AI代谢功能障碍相关脂肪性肝病（AI-MASLD）”概念，发现所有测试模型均存在不同程度的功能缺陷，尤其在高噪声环境下易崩溃，强调当前LLMs仅可作为人类专家监督下的辅助工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为系统评估大语言模型在真实临床环境中处理复杂、含噪患者主诉的能力，并探究其是否存在类似代谢功能障碍相关脂肪性肝病（MASLD）的功能退化现象，以揭示AI在医疗应用中的潜在风险。

Method: 采用基于标准化医疗探针的横断面分析设计，选取GPT-4o、Gemini 2.5、DeepSeek 3.1和Qwen3-Max四款主流大语言模型作为研究对象；构建涵盖五个核心维度、共二十个医疗探针的评估体系，模拟真实临床沟通环境；所有探针由临床专家制定金标准答案，并由两名独立临床医生采用双盲反向评分量表进行评估。

Result: 所有测试模型均表现出不同程度的功能缺陷，其中Qwen3-Max整体表现最佳，Gemini 2.5最差；在极端噪声条件下，多数模型出现功能性崩溃；特别地，GPT-4o在深静脉血栓继发肺栓塞（PE）的风险评估中出现严重误判。

Conclusion: 该研究首次实证确认大语言模型在处理临床信息时表现出类似代谢功能障碍的特征，提出“AI-MASLD”新概念，警示当前AI在医疗应用中存在显著安全风险，强调必须在人类专家监督下将其作为辅助工具使用。

Abstract: This study aims to simulate real-world clinical scenarios to systematically evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract core medical information from patient chief complaints laden with noise and redundancy, and to verify whether they exhibit a functional decline analogous to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). We employed a cross-sectional analysis design based on standardized medical probes, selecting four mainstream LLMs as research subjects: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, and Qwen3-Max. An evaluation system comprising twenty medical probes across five core dimensions was used to simulate a genuine clinical communication environment. All probes had gold-standard answers defined by clinical experts and were assessed via a double-blind, inverse rating scale by two independent clinicians. The results show that all tested models exhibited functional defects to varying degrees, with Qwen3-Max demonstrating the best overall performance and Gemini 2.5 the worst. Under conditions of extreme noise, most models experienced a functional collapse. Notably, GPT-4o made a severe misjudgment in the risk assessment for pulmonary embolism (PE) secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This research is the first to empirically confirm that LLMs exhibit features resembling metabolic dysfunction when processing clinical information, proposing the innovative concept of "AI-Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (AI-MASLD)". These findings offer a crucial safety warning for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, emphasizing that current LLMs must be used as auxiliary tools under human expert supervision, as there remains a significant gap between their theoretical knowledge and practical clinical application.

Conclusion: 为跟上AI快速发展并支持负责任的部署，基准测试必须向动态化、包容性和应用相关性转型，这需要技术创新与系统性教育并重，社区合作是关键基础。

Abstract: Benchmarks are a cornerstone of modern machine learning, enabling reproducibility, comparison, and scientific progress. However, AI benchmarks are increasingly complex, requiring dynamic, AI-focused workflows. Rapid evolution in model architectures, scale, datasets, and deployment contexts makes evaluation a moving target. Large language models often memorize static benchmarks, causing a gap between benchmark results and real-world performance.
  Beyond traditional static benchmarks, continuous adaptive benchmarking frameworks are needed to align scientific assessment with deployment risks. This calls for skills and education in AI Benchmark Carpentry. From our experience with MLCommons, educational initiatives, and programs like the DOE's Trillion Parameter Consortium, key barriers include high resource demands, limited access to specialized hardware, lack of benchmark design expertise, and uncertainty in relating results to application domains. Current benchmarks often emphasize peak performance on top-tier hardware, offering limited guidance for diverse, real-world scenarios.
  Benchmarking must become dynamic, incorporating evolving models, updated data, and heterogeneous platforms while maintaining transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability. Democratization requires both technical innovation and systematic education across levels, building sustained expertise in benchmark design and use. Benchmarks should support application-relevant comparisons, enabling informed, context-sensitive decisions. Dynamic, inclusive benchmarking will ensure evaluation keeps pace with AI evolution and supports responsible, reproducible, and accessible AI deployment. Community efforts can provide a foundation for AI Benchmark Carpentry.

Motivation: 能源需求受天气条件和日历信息等多重因素影响，且这些因素之间存在因果依赖关系，传统基于相关性的方法难以充分建模此类复杂关系。

Method: 构建结构因果模型以刻画变量间的因果关系，并基于该因果洞察构建贝叶斯预测模型，将因果知识作为先验信息引入模型训练。

Conclusion: 利用结构因果模型揭示能源需求与影响因素之间的因果机制，并将其融入贝叶斯预测框架，可显著提升预测精度和稳定性。

Abstract: Energy demand prediction is critical for grid operators, industrial energy
  consumers, and service providers. Energy demand is influenced by multiple
  factors, including weather conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind
  speed, solar radiation), and calendar information (e.g. hour of day and
  month of year), which further affect daily work and life schedules. These
  factors are causally interdependent, making the problem more complex than
  simple correlation-based learning techniques satisfactorily allow for. We
  propose a structural causal model that explains the causal relationship
  between these variables. A full analysis is performed to validate our causal
  beliefs, also revealing important insights consistent with prior studies.
  For example, our causal model reveals that energy demand responds to
  temperature fluctuations with season-dependent sensitivity. Additionally, we
  find that energy demand exhibits lower variance in winter due to the
  decoupling effect between temperature changes and daily activity patterns.
  We then build a Bayesian model, which takes advantage of the causal insights
  we learned as prior knowledge. The model is trained and tested on unseen
  data and yields state-of-the-art performance in the form of a 3.84 percent MAPE on
  the test set. The model also demonstrates strong robustness, as the
  cross-validation across two years of data yields an average MAPE of 3.88 percent.

Motivation: 临床医学中的治疗决策涉及患者特征、疾病过程和药物之间的复杂交互，需要可靠且多步骤的推理。通用RAG系统难以满足医疗场景对安全性和准确性的严苛要求，因此需开发专门针对治疗推理的评估与执行机制。

Method: 采用微调后的Llama-3.1-8B模型构建TxAgent，通过迭代式检索增强生成动态调用统一生物医学工具集（ToolUniverse），整合FDA Drug API、OpenTargets和Monarch等资源；将推理轨迹和工具调用序列作为显式监督信号进行评估。

Result: 在CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025挑战赛中，TxAgent在正确性、工具使用和推理质量等指标上表现优异，验证了改进工具检索策略对整体性能的提升作用，并荣获开放科学卓越奖。

Conclusion: 面向治疗决策的智能体AI系统需兼顾推理准确性与工具调用可靠性，通过专用工具集成与精细化评估协议可显著提升临床AI系统的实用性与安全性。

Abstract: Therapeutic decision-making in clinical medicine constitutes a high-stakes domain in which AI guidance interacts with complex interactions among patient characteristics, disease processes, and pharmacological agents. Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies. Our work was awarded the Excellence Award in Open Science. Complete information can be found at https://curebench.ai/.
