Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels.

In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs.

Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u56da\u5f92\u56f0\u5883\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9c\u4eba\u6027\u662f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4eba\u683c\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u66f4\u50cf\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u7f6e\u800c\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6218\u7565\u4e0e\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u56da\u5f92\u56f0\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u4e94\u4eba\u683c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u4e94\u4eba\u683c\u91cf\u8868\u6d4b\u91cfGPT-3.5-turbo\u3001GPT-4o\u548cGPT-5\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u6ce8\u5165\u4eba\u683c\u4fe1\u606f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u5c06\u5404\u4eba\u683c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6781\u7aef\u5316\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u5176\u72ec\u7acb\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9c\u4eba\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u683c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u663e\u5f0f\u4eba\u683c\u4fe1\u606f\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u4f5c\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u589e\u52a0\u88ab\u5265\u524a\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff1b\u540e\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5177\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u683c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bf9LLM\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u51b3\u5b9a\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHyper-Enz\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u8d85\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8d85\u56feTransformer\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u7ef4\u62a4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b\u800c\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u4f46\u5173\u7cfb\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\uff08\u5e95\u7269\uff0c\u9176\uff0c\u4ea7\u7269\uff09\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408\u8d85\u56feTransformer\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u7684Hyper-Enz\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8303\u5f0f\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9176\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe88%\uff0c\u5728\u914d\u5bf9\u7ea7\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u63d0\u534730%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0Hyper-Enz\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u591a\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4e0e\u9176\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9176-\u5e95\u7269\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Moreover, we use Nash Clustering to select the strategy to be eliminated, ensuring that the number of strategies within the strategy window is effectively limited.

However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\\sim+20\\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $\u03ba= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

A recently proposed auction-based parking assignment can alleviate cruising for parking and also set a market-driven, demand-responsive parking price. However, the wide acceptance of such a system is far from certain.\n  To evaluate the merits of auction-based parking assignment, we assume that drivers have access to a smartphone-based reservation system prior to its mandatory introduction and thus have the opportunity to test and experience its merits voluntarily. We set our experiment as Eclipse SUMO simulations with different rates of participants and non-participants to check how different market penetration levels affect the traffic flow, the performance of the auction-based assignment system, and the financial outcomes. The results show that the auction-based system improves traffic flow with increasing penetration rates, allowing participants to park gradually closer to their preferred parking lots. However, it comes with a price; the system also increases parking expenditures for participants. Interestingly, non-participating drivers will face even higher parking prices. Consequently, they will be motivated to use the new system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7SUMO\u4eff\u771f\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u505c\u8f66\u5206\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u60f3\u505c\u8f66\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u63d0\u9ad8\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u505c\u8f66\u8d39\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u975e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u9ad8\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u80fd\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5176\u52a0\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u514d\u8d39\u505c\u8f66\u4f4d\u65e5\u76ca\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u505c\u8f66\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u867d\u6709\u671b\u7f13\u89e3\u5de1\u6e38\u627e\u8f66\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Eclipse SUMO\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u7528\u6237\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u9884\u7ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff09\u4e0e\u975e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u8d22\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u7cfb\u7edf\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u80fd\u505c\u5f97\u66f4\u9760\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u5730\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u652f\u4ed8\u66f4\u9ad8\u505c\u8f66\u8d39\uff1b\u975e\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5219\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u52a0\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u505c\u8f66\u5206\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u505c\u8f66\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u653f\u7b56\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u52a0\u4ee5\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Attention maps describe where weight mass concentrates; they do not reveal whether queries and keys trade position, content, or both. We introduce Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: first, an ANOVA-based decomposition statistically disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; second, SVD of the query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes that reveal how these factors mediate communication. After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling. DINOv2 allocates more energy to content-position than supervised models and distributes computation across a richer mode spectrum. (ii) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization: heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators, while singular modes within heads show analogous specialization. (iii) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers that simultaneously preserve positional structure while contextually enriching semantic content.\n  Overall, BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors - positional or semantic - mediate their communication, yielding practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u6b63\u4ea4\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\uff08BFD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u6790Vision Transformer\u4e2d\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5b58\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u7279\u5316\u3001\u4ee5\u53caDINOv2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9Vision Transformer\u4e2d\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9token\u95f4\u4ea4\u6362\u4fe1\u606f\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u8fd8\u662f\u4e24\u8005\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u89e3\u8026\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faBFD\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eANOVA\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u5c06token\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6b63\u4ea4\u5730\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5bf9\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u4ea4\u4e92\u77e9\u9635QK^T\u8fdb\u884c\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\uff08SVD\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u5b50\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6b63\u4ea4\u6a21\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a(i) \u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5185\u5bb9-\u5185\u5bb9\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0cDINOv2\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5f3a\u8c03\u5185\u5bb9-\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8026\u5408\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u6001\uff1b(ii) \u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u53ca\u5185\u90e8\u5947\u5f02\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\u7279\u5316\uff1b(iii) DINOv2\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u5f62\u72b6\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "BFD\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Vision Transformer\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u56e0\u5b50\u8fdb\u884ctoken\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, current LLM-based systems typically generate narratives and visualizations in staged pipelines, following either a text-first-graph-second or a graph-first-text-second paradigm. These designs often lead to chart-text inconsistency and insight freezing, where the intermediate evidence space becomes fixed and the model can no longer retrieve or construct new visual evidence as the narrative evolves, resulting in shallow and predefined analysis. To address the limitations, we propose \\textbf{EvidFuse}, a training-free multi-agent framework that enables writing-time text-chart interleaved generation for data-driven reports. EvidFuse decouples visualization analysis from long-form drafting via two collaborating components: a \\textbf{Data-Augmented Analysis Agent}, equipped with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)-derived knowledge and access to raw tables, and a \\textbf{Real-Time Evidence Construction Writer} that plans an outline and drafts the report while intermittently issuing fine-grained analysis requests. This design allows visual evidence to be constructed and incorporated exactly when the narrative requires it, directly constraining subsequent claims and enabling on-demand expansion of the evidence space.

Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images.

Monocular reconstruction is inherently ill-posed due to the lack of sufficient multiview constraints, making accurate recovery of object geometry and temporal coherence particularly challenging. To address this, we leverage multiple geometric cues, such as depth, optical flow, dynamic object segmentation, and point tracking. Combined with rigidity-based motion constraints, these cues allow us to estimate preliminary 3D scene dynamics during an initialization stage. Recovering scene dynamics prior to the photometric optimization reduces reliance on motion inference from visual appearance alone, which is often ambiguous in monocular settings. To enable compact representations, fast training, and real-time rendering while supporting non-rigid deformations, the scene is decomposed into static and dynamic components. Each Gaussian in the dynamic part of the scene is assigned a trajectory represented as time-dependent Poly-Fourier curve for parameter-efficient motion encoding.

While robust for general-purpose assistants, this one-size-fits-all ethical framework imposes a \"transparency tax\" on professional domains requiring strategic ambiguity and information withholding, such as public relations, negotiation, and crisis management. To measure this gap between general safety and professional utility, we introduce Crisis-Bench, a multi-agent Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that evaluates LLMs in high-stakes corporate crises. Spanning 80 diverse storylines across 8 industries, Crisis-Bench tasks an LLM-based Public Relations (PR) Agent with navigating a dynamic 7-day corporate crisis simulation while managing strictly separated Private and Public narrative states to enforce rigorous information asymmetry. Unlike traditional benchmarks that rely on static ground truths, we introduce the Adjudicator-Market Loop: a novel evaluation metric where public sentiment is adjudicated and translated into a simulated stock price, creating a realistic economic incentive structure. Our results expose a critical dichotomy: while some models capitulate to ethical concerns, others demonstrate the capacity for Machiavellian, legitimate strategic withholding in order to stabilize the simulated stock price.

Radiomics and deep learning (DL) have shown significant potential in assisting radiologists with early cancer detection. This paper aims to critically assess the performance of radiomics, DL, and ensemble techniques in detecting cancer from screening mammograms. Two independent datasets were used: the RSNA 2023 Breast Cancer Detection Challenge (11,913 patients) and a Mexican cohort from the TecSalud dataset (19,400 patients). The ConvNeXtV1-small DL model was trained on the RSNA dataset and validated on the TecSalud dataset, while radiomics models were developed using the TecSalud dataset and validated with a leave-one-year-out approach. The ensemble method consistently combined and calibrated predictions using the same methodology. Results showed that the ensemble approach achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, compared to 0.83 for ConvNeXtV1-small and 0.80 for radiomics.

This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.\n  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ea7\u751f\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u671f\u671b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u201d\u548c\u201c\u671f\u671bF1\u5206\u6570\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u6309\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u4e13\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u7b54\u6848\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u666e\u904d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5c24\u5176\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u8ba4\u4e3a\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u6807\u51c6\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u201c\u671f\u671b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u201d\u548c\u201c\u671f\u671bF1\u5206\u6570\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u6839\u636e\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e00\u81f4\u7387\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u7b54\u6848\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u80fd\u5f88\u5c0f\uff1b\u800c\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u9ad8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u624d\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u5206\u3002\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e8e80%\u65f6\uff09\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e94\u4f9d\u636e\u6807\u51c6\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08\u5982\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e00\u81f4\u7387\uff09\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3002"}}

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how \"rare\" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u706b\u707e\u758f\u6563\uff09\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f99%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5b8c\u6574\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u548cVLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u751a\u81f3\u4e3a0%\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8ba4\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5176\u9519\u8bef\u53ef\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5371\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u547d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u201c\u5fae\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u5373\u707e\u96be\u201d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u706b\u707e\u758f\u6563\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e03\u9879\u5b9a\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff1a\u5b8c\u6574\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u4f7f\u7528ASCII\u5730\u56fe\uff09\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff08SOSR\uff0c\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u5371\u6025\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\uff09\u3002\u5bf9\u591a\u79cdLLM\u548cVLM\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u67901%\u5931\u8d25\u7387\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5371\u5bb3\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728ASCII\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e3a0%\uff1b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u706b\u8b66\u6f14\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u793a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u671d\u5371\u9669\u533a\u57df\u800c\u975e\u5b89\u5168\u51fa\u53e3\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u4e25\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5c1a\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c99%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6bcf\u767e\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c31\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u4e00\u6b21\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002"}}

Existing large vision-language model (LVLM) approaches leverage world knowledge, chain-of-thought reasoning, and agentic capabilities, but overlook a common strategy used by humans -- using maps. In this work, we first equip the model \\textit{Thinking with Map} ability and formulate it as an agent-in-the-map loop. We develop a two-stage optimization scheme for it, including agentic reinforcement learning (RL) followed by parallel test-time scaling (TTS). The RL strengthens the agentic capability of model to improve sampling efficiency, and the parallel TTS enables the model to explore multiple candidate paths before making the final prediction, which is crucial for geolocalization. To evaluate our method on up-to-date and in-the-wild images, we further present MAPBench, a comprehensive geolocalization training and evaluation benchmark composed entirely of real-world images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on most metrics, specifically improving Acc@500m from 8.0\\% to 22.1\\% compared to \\textit{Gemini-3-Pro} with Google Search/Map grounded mode.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u601d\u8003\u201d\uff08Thinking with Map\uff09\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60+\u5e76\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6MAPBench\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u601d\u8003\u201d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6761\u5019\u9009\u8def\u5f84\u4ee5\u505a\u51fa\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684MAPBench\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728MAPBench\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6570\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4Gemini-3-Pro\uff08\u542f\u7528Google\u641c\u7d22/\u5730\u56fe\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\uff0cAcc@500m\u4ece8.0%\u63d0\u5347\u81f322.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u5730\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5546\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u91d1\u878d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7535\u5546\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Group Sequence Policy Optimization\uff08GSPO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u4ea4\u6613\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u5ba2\u6237\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u7269\u6d41\u8be6\u60c5\u3001\u5546\u54c1\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u8ba2\u5355\u5386\u53f2\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6b3a\u8bc8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u5546\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, accurate imaging of roots in subterranean environments remains a persistent challenge due to adverse conditions such as occlusion, varying soil moisture, and inherently low contrast, which limit the effectiveness of conventional vision-based approaches. In this work, we propose a novel underground imaging system that captures multiple overlapping views of plant roots and integrates a deep learning-based Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) framework designed to enhance root visibility and detail. To train and evaluate our approach, we construct a synthetic dataset that simulates realistic underground imaging scenarios, incorporating key environmental factors that affect image quality. Our proposed MISR algorithm leverages spatial redundancy across views to reconstruct high-resolution images with improved structural fidelity and visual clarity. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art super resolution baselines, achieving a 2.3 percent reduction in BRISQUE, indicating improved image quality with the same CLIP-IQA score, thereby enabling enhanced phenotypic analysis of root systems. This, in turn, facilitates accurate estimation of critical root traits, including root hair count and root hair density. The proposed framework presents a promising direction for robust automatic underground plant root imaging and trait quantification for agricultural and ecological research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08MISR\uff09\u7684\u5730\u4e0b\u690d\u7269\u6839\u7cfb\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u91cd\u53e0\u89c6\u89d2\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u6839\u7cfb\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0e\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u91cf\u5316\u6839\u7cfb\u6027\u72b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u4e0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u690d\u7269\u6839\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u6210\u50cf\u9762\u4e34\u906e\u6321\u3001\u571f\u58e4\u6e7f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6210\u50cf\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u5730\u4e0b\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08MISR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6839\u7cfb\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cBRISQUE\u964d\u4f4e2.3%\uff0cCLIP-IQA\u5f97\u5206\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6839\u6bdb\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6027\u72b6\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5730\u4e0b\u690d\u7269\u6839\u7cfb\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6210\u50cf\u4e0e\u6027\u72b6\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u4e0e\u751f\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the\n  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8861\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u5dee\u6cc4\u9732\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u70b9\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u504f\u5b66\u4e60\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u8054\u5408\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u5ea6\u91cf\u5269\u4f59\u504f\u5dee\u6216\u63d0\u4f9b\u98ce\u9669\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCM\uff09\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u504f\u5dee\u6cc4\u9732\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u91cd\u9c81\u68d2\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6Learning-to-Rank\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u504f\u5dee\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u504f\u5dee\u5171\u5b58\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4ece\u70b9\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u5b9e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Gray matter volume was analyzed using a general linear model, with the diagnostic group as primary predictor and age and total intracranial volume as covariates. Statistical maps were thresholded at p < 0.001 (voxelwise) and corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level using family-wise error (FWE) correction (p < 0.05). Significant hippocampal atrophy was observed in AD relative to CN and MCI (Cohen's d = 2.03 and 1.61, respectively).

Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs.

To address these limitations, we introduce MMViR, a novel multi-modal, multi-grained structured representation for long video understanding.

This design supports efficient query-based retrieval and generalizes well across various scenarios.

Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model).

Yet, current advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) usually remain structurally blind to this information.

Furthermore, existing structural analysis methods are often script-specific and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose Hieroglyphic Stroke Analyzer (HieroSA), a novel and generalizable framework that enables MLLMs to automatically derive stroke-level structures from character bitmaps without handcrafted data. It transforms modern logographic and ancient hieroglyphs character images into explicit, interpretable line-segment representations in a normalized coordinate space, allowing for cross-lingual generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HieroSA effectively captures character-internal structures and semantics, bypassing the need for language-specific priors.

However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \\textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space.

Conventional video swapping frameworks are limited to generating facial representations in pixel-based formats. The resulting swapped faces exist merely as a set of unstructured pixels without any capacity for animation or interactive manipulation. Our work introduces a paradigm shift from conventional pixel-based video generation to the creation of high-fidelity avatar with swapped faces. The framework first preprocesses target video to extract FLAME parameters, camera poses and segmentation masks, and then rigs 3D Gaussian splats to the FLAME model across frames, enabling dynamic facial control. To ensure identity preserving, we propose an compound identity embedding constructed from three state-of-the-art face recognition models for avatar finetuning.

In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction.

However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u903b\u8f91\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5e95\u5c42\u903b\u8f91\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u7ec4\u4ef6\u800c\u975e\u56fa\u5b9a\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LogiKEy\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u903b\u8f91\u5d4c\u5165\u9ad8\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u903b\u8f91\u5728\u89c4\u8303\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4e14\u903b\u8f91\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u7406\u8bc1\u660e\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u5f0f\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u89c4\u8303\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u5207\u6362\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528LogiKEy\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u975e\u7ecf\u5178\u903b\u8f91\uff08\u5982\u9053\u4e49\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u903b\u8f91\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u9ad8\u9636\u903b\u8f91\uff08HOL\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u903b\u8f91\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7NLI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u201c\u903b\u8f91\u5916\u90e8\u201d\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u7406\u7f16\u7801\u89c4\u8303\u8981\u6c42\uff09\u4e0e\u201c\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u90e8\u201d\uff08\u89c4\u8303\u6a21\u5f0f\u7531\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u6784\u5185\u751f\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u5185\u90e8\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347NLI\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8bc1\u660e\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u903b\u8f91\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u5404\u5f02\uff1a\u4e00\u9636\u903b\u8f91\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u9053\u4e49\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u903b\u8f91\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u903b\u8f91\u4f5c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u7b49\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To overcome these challenges, we propose DIFF-MF, a novel difference-driven channel-spatial state space model for multi-modal image fusion. Our approach leverages feature discrepancy maps between modalities to guide feature extraction, followed by a fusion process across both channel and spatial dimensions. In the channel dimension, a channel-exchange module enhances channel-wise interaction through cross-attention dual state space modeling, enabling adaptive feature reweighting. In the spatial dimension, a spatial-exchange module employs cross-modal state space scanning to achieve comprehensive spatial fusion. By efficiently capturing global dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity, DIFF-MF effectively integrates complementary multi-modal features. Experimental results on the driving scenarios and low-altitude UAV datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDIFF-MF\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5dee\u5f02\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u901a\u9053-\u7a7a\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u7ea2\u5916\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u5f3a\u8c03\u7ea2\u5916\u5f3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u6216\u4fdd\u7559\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u7ed3\u6784\u4f46\u524a\u5f31\u70ed\u76ee\u6807\u663e\u8457\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u4e24\u8005\u3002", "method": "DIFF-MF\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u9053\u4ea4\u6362\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53cc\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u6362\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u626b\u63cf\uff09\u5206\u522b\u5728\u901a\u9053\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u548c\u4f4e\u7a7a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DIFF-MF\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u548c\u901a\u9053-\u7a7a\u95f4\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

To mitigate this limitation, mainstream approaches typically rely on external control signals to explicitly constrain the spatial layout, local semantic and visual attributes of images. However, this strong dependency makes the input format rigid, rendering it incompatible with the heterogeneous resource conditions of users and diverse constraint requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MoGen, a user-friendly multi-object image generation method. First, we design a Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) module that precisely anchors phrase units in language descriptions to their corresponding image regions during the generation process, enabling text-to-image generation that follows quantity specifications for multiple objects. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce an Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) module, which adaptively parses and integrates various combinations of multi-source control signals to formulate corresponding structured intent. This intent subsequently guides selective constraints on scene layouts and object attributes, achieving dynamic fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that MoGen significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, while exhibiting superior accessibility and control flexibility.

We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PII-VisBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b4000\u4e2a\u63a2\u9488\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\uff08PII\uff09\u7684\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9ad8\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u4e2a\u4f53\u66f4\u6613\u6cc4\u9732PII\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548cPII\u7c7b\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9VLM\u4e2dPII\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u5c06\u9690\u79c1\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e2a\u4f53\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5bf9\u5176\u9690\u79c1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e3a\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8003\u8651\u4e3b\u4f53\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9690\u79c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaPII-VisBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6200\u540d\u4e3b\u4f53\uff08\u6309\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u5206\u4e3a\u9ad8\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u4f4e\u3001\u96f6\u56db\u7c7b\uff09\uff0c\u51714000\u4e2a\u63a2\u9488\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f3018\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90VLM\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a210.3B\u201332B\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u548c\u6761\u4ef6PII\u62ab\u9732\u7387\u4e24\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6539\u5199\u4e0e\u8d8a\u72f1\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u4e3b\u4f53\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u62d2\u7edd\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\uff0cPII\u62ab\u9732\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u4ece\u9ad8\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea69.10%\u964d\u81f3\u4f4e\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea65.34%\uff09\uff1b\u9ad8\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u4e3b\u4f53\u66f4\u6613\u88ab\u6cc4\u9732PII\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548cPII\u7c7b\u578b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u6539\u5199\u548c\u8d8a\u72f1\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u66b4\u9732\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "conclusion": "VLM\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u5176\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u7eb3\u5165\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u53d1\u5c55\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Existing hallucination detection methods primarily rely on output logits or external verification tools, often overlooking their internal mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the outputs of internal attention heads, postulating that specific heads carry the primary signals for truthful generation.However, directly probing these high-dimensional states is challenging due to the entanglement of visual-linguistic syntax and noise. To address this, we propose VIB-Probe, a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework leveraging the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory. Our method extracts discriminative patterns across layers and heads while filtering out semantic nuisances through the information bottleneck principle. Furthermore, by leveraging the gradients of our VIB probe, we identify attention heads with strong causal influence on hallucinations and introduce an inference-time intervention strategy for hallucination mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that VIB-Probe significantly outperforms existing baselines in both settings.

However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks.

We have witnessed significant progress in widely use of visual-language foundational models in recent approaches. However, current methods often struggle with complex prompt engineering, elaborate adaptation modules, and challenging training strategies, ultimately limiting their flexibility and generality. To address these issues, this paper rethinks the fundamental mechanism behind visual-language models for AD and presents an embarrassingly simple, general, and effective framework for Universal vision Anomaly Detection (UniADet). Specifically, we first find language encoder is used to derive decision weights for anomaly classification and segmentation, and then demonstrate that it is unnecessary for universal AD. Second, we propose an embarrassingly simple method to completely decouple classification and segmentation, and decouple cross-level features, i.e., learning independent weights for different tasks and hierarchical features. UniADet is highly simple (learning only decoupled weights), parameter-efficient (only 0.002M learnable parameters), general (adapting a variety of foundation models), and effective (surpassing state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot by a large margin and even full-shot AD methods for the first time) on 14 real-world AD benchmarks covering both industrial and medical domains.

Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

However, acquiring a large amount of labeled facial expression data is often costly. Therefore, it is particularly important to design a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm that makes full use of both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm based on Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA) and Selective Negative Learning (SNL). Initially, we designed strategies for local attention enhancement and random dropout of feature maps during feature extraction, which strengthen the representation of local features while ensuring the model does not overfit to any specific local area. Furthermore, this study introduces a dynamic thresholding method to adapt to the requirements of the semi-supervised learning framework for facial expression recognition tasks, and through a selective negative learning strategy, it fully utilizes unlabeled samples with low confidence by mining useful expression information from complementary labels, achieving impressive results. We have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets.

However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faStackPlanner\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9ad8\u5c42\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u5468\u671f\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u957f\u5468\u671f\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81a8\u80c0\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u53ca\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002", "method": "StackPlanner\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u8026\u9ad8\u5c42\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u590d\u7528\u534f\u8c03\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u957f\u5468\u671f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "StackPlanner\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u590d\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u534f\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This covert harm is harder to detect than explicit misinformation yet remains underexplored. To address this gap, we develop a multi-stage pipeline that disentangles and simulates preview-based versus context-based understanding, enabling construction of the MM-Misleading benchmark. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate open-source LVLMs and uncover pronounced blind spots to omission-based misleadingness detection. We further propose OMGuard, which integrates (1) Interpretation-Aware Fine-Tuning, which used to improve multimodal misleadingness detection and (2) Rationale-Guided Misleading Content Correction, which uses explicit rationales to guide headline rewriting and reduce misleading impressions. Experiments show that OMGuard lifts an 8B model's detection accuracy to match a 235B LVLM and delivers markedly stronger end-to-end correction. Further analysis reveals that misleadingness typically stems from local narrative shifts (e.g., missing background) rather than global frame changes, and identifies image-driven scenarios where text-only correction fails, highlighting the necessity of visual interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u65b0\u95fb\u9884\u89c8\uff08\u56fe\u50cf-\u6807\u9898\u5bf9\uff09\u56e0\u7701\u7565\u5173\u952e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u800c\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u201c\u89e3\u8bfb\u504f\u79fb\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86MM-Misleading\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OMGuard\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLM\uff09\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u9690\u6027\u8bef\u5bfc\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u663e\u6027\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u3001\u4f46\u56e0\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7701\u7565\u5173\u952e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bfb\u8005\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u5168\u6587\u4e0d\u7b26\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u9690\u6027\u8bef\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u7c7b\u201c\u89e3\u8bfb\u504f\u79fb\u201d\u66f4\u96be\u5bdf\u89c9\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u5e76\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u89c8\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u6587\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6784\u5efaMM-Misleading\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u63d0\u51faOMGuard\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u201c\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u8bfb\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u201d\u548c\u201c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u7531\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u5185\u5bb9\u4fee\u6b63\u201d\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7701\u7565\u578b\u8bef\u5bfc\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOMGuard\u53ef\u4f7f8B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5ab2\u7f8e235B LVLM\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4fee\u6b63\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u8bef\u5bfc\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u53d9\u4e8b\u504f\u79fb\uff08\u5982\u7f3a\u5931\u80cc\u666f\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ec5\u9760\u6587\u672c\u4fee\u6b63\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7701\u7565\u5173\u952e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9020\u6210\u7684\u9690\u6027\u8bef\u5bfc\u662f\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u65b0\u95fb\u9884\u89c8\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b\u6240\u63d0OMGuard\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bef\u5bfc\u5185\u5bb9\u6cbb\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field.

In this work, we propose a scalable multi-image editing framework for UMMs that explicitly distinguishes image identities and generalizes to variable input counts. Algorithmically, we introduce two innovations: 1) The learnable latent separators explicitly differentiate each reference image in the latent space, enabling accurate and disentangled conditioning. 2) The sinusoidal index encoding assigns visual tokens from the same image a continuous sinusoidal index embedding, which provides explicit image identity while allowing generalization and extrapolation on a variable number of inputs. To facilitate training and evaluation, we establish a high-fidelity benchmark using an inverse dataset construction methodology to guarantee artifact-free, achievable outputs. Experiments show clear improvements in semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and cross-image integration over prior baselines on diverse multi-image editing tasks, validating our advantages on consistency and generalization ability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u9694\u7b26\u548c\u6b63\u5f26\u7d22\u5f15\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4f7f\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08UMMs\uff09\u80fd\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53ef\u53d8\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u533a\u5206\u5404\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u9694\u7b26\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u533a\u5206\u6bcf\u5f20\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89e3\u8026\u5408\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff1b2\uff09\u6b63\u5f26\u7d22\u5f15\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4e3a\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\u5206\u914d\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u6b63\u5f26\u7d22\u5f15\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u7559\u56fe\u50cf\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53c8\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u53ef\u53d8\u6570\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5916\u63a8\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.

Current detection methods often struggle to generalize to unseen generative models, and the rapid evolution of generative techniques continuously exacerbates this challenge. Without adaptability, detection models risk becoming ineffective in real-world applications. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel three-stage domain continual learning framework designed for continuous adaptation to evolving generative models. In the first stage, we employ a strategic parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to develop a transferable offline detection model with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, the second stage integrates unseen data streams into a continual learning process. To efficiently learn from limited samples of novel generated models and mitigate overfitting, we design a data augmentation chain with progressively increasing complexity. Furthermore, we leverage the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) method to approximate the Hessian and alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Finally, the third stage utilizes a linear interpolation strategy based on Linear Mode Connectivity, effectively capturing commonalities across diverse generative models and further enhancing overall performance.

To tackle this issue, this study proposes the GS-DMSR method. By quantitatively analyzing the dynamic evolution process of Gaussian attributes, this mechanism achieves adaptive gradient focusing, enabling it to dynamically identify significant differences in the motion states of Gaussian models. It then applies differentiated optimization strategies to Gaussian models with varying degrees of significance, thereby significantly improving the model convergence rate. Additionally, this research integrates a multi-scale manifold enhancement module, which leverages the collaborative optimization of an implicit nonlinear decoder and an explicit deformation field to enhance the modeling efficiency for complex deformation scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves a frame rate of up to 96 FPS on synthetic datasets, while effectively reducing both storage overhead and training time.Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GS-DMSR-2212.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGS-DMSR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u805a\u7126\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6d41\u5f62\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u53473D\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u57283D\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGS-DMSR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u65af\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u805a\u7126\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u65bd\u52a0\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6d41\u5f62\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u5f0f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523096 FPS\u7684\u5e27\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "GS-DMSR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

This reasoning unfaithfulness frequently manifests as hallucinated entities, mis-grounded relations, skipped steps, and over-specified reasoning. Existing preference-based approaches, typically relying on textual perturbations or answer-conditioned rationales, fail to address this challenge as they allow models to exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding. To address this, we propose SceneAlign, a framework that leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. By identifying reasoning-critical nodes and perturbing them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, SceneAlign constructs hard negative rationales that remain linguistically plausible but are grounded in inaccurate visual facts. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization to steer models toward fine-grained, structure-faithful reasoning.

Most gait models strive to implicitly learn the common traits across different gait conditions in a data-driven manner to pull different gait conditions closer for recognition. However, relatively few studies have explicitly explored the inherent relations between different gait conditions. For this purpose, we attempt to establish connections among different gait conditions and propose a new perspective to achieve gait recognition: variations in different gait conditions can be approximately viewed as a combination of geometric transformations. In this case, all we need is to determine the types of geometric transformations and achieve geometric invariance, then identity invariance naturally follows. As an initial attempt, we explore three common geometric transformations (i.e., Reflect, Rotate, and Scale) and design a $\\mathcal{R}$eflect-$\\mathcal{R}$otate-$\\mathcal{S}$cale invariance learning framework, named ${\\mathcal{RRS}}$-Gait.

Due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning, automated chart understanding poses a significant challenge to existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Many MLLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) face the challenge of credit assignment. Their advantage estimation, typically performed at the trajectory level, cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps within a single generated response. To address this limitation, we introduce SketchVL, a novel MLLM that optimized with FinePO, a new RL algorithm designed for fine-grained credit assignment within each trajectory. SketchVL's methodology involves drawing its intermediate reasoning steps as markers on the image and feeding the annotated image back to itself, creating a robust, multi-step reasoning process. During training, the FinePO algorithm leverages a Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action within a trajectory, thereby precisely assigning credit for each step. This mechanism allows FinePO to more strongly reward correct tokens when a trajectory is globally successful, and more heavily penalize incorrect tokens when the trajectory is globally suboptimal, thus achieving fine-grained reinforcement signals. Experiments show that SketchVL learns to align its step-level behavior with the FinePRM, achieving an average performance gain of 7.23\\% over its base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics, providing a promising new direction for training powerful reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSketchVL\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5FinePO\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7ed8\u5236\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08FinePRM\uff09\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLM\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u5c42\u9762\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u5404\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "SketchVL\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7ed8\u5236\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6807\u8bb0\u5e76\u5c06\u6807\u6ce8\u540e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u53cd\u9988\u7ed9\u81ea\u8eab\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FinePO\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u501f\u52a9FinePRM\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ed8\u56fe\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSketchVL\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53477.23%\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e86\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0eFinePRM\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "SketchVL\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684MLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Besides, we formulate a mutual-information-based objective to promote consistency among shared representations and suppress information overlap between view-specific representation and other modalities. Theoretically, we derive the tractable bounds to train the dual-channel network. Moreover, ADRL performs prototype-specific feature selection by enabling independent interactions between label embeddings and view representations, accompanied by the generation of pseudo-labels for each category.

To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning.

From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories.

Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains.

Current approaches primarily exploit only final-layer representations, while training-free methods require multiple forward passes or backpropagation. We propose ViTNT-FIQA, a training-free approach that measures the stability of patch embedding evolution across intermediate Vision Transformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that high-quality face images exhibit stable feature refinement trajectories across blocks, while degraded images show erratic transformations. Our method computes Euclidean distances between L2-normalized patch embeddings from consecutive transformer blocks and aggregates them into image-level quality scores. We empirically validate this correlation on a quality-labeled synthetic dataset with controlled degradation levels. Unlike existing training-free approaches, ViTNT-FIQA requires only a single forward pass without backpropagation or architectural modifications. Through extensive evaluation on eight benchmarks (LFW, AgeDB-30, CFP-FP, CALFW, Adience, CPLFW, XQLFW, IJB-C), we show that ViTNT-FIQA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and immediate applicability to any pre-trained ViT-based face recognition model.", "AI": {"tldr": "ViTNT-FIQA \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790 Vision Transformer \u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42 patch \u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6216\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u6216\u9002\u7528\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa ViTNT-FIQA \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97 Vision Transformer \u76f8\u90bb\u4e2d\u95f4\u5757\u4e4b\u95f4 L2 \u5f52\u4e00\u5316 patch \u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6b27\u6c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8861\u91cf\u5176\u6f14\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982 LFW\u3001IJB-C \u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86 ViTNT-FIQA \u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "conclusion": "ViTNT-FIQA \u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528 ViT \u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Conventional single-layer reconstruction methods lock clothing to one identity, while prior multi-layer approaches struggle with occluded regions. We overcome both limitations by encoding each layer as a set of 2D Gaussians for accurate geometry and photorealistic rendering, and inpainting hidden regions with a pretrained 2D diffusion model via score-distillation sampling (SDS). Our three-stage training strategy first reconstructs the coarse canonical garment via single-layer reconstruction, followed by multi-layer training to jointly recover the inner-layer body and outer-layer garment details. Experiments on two 3D human benchmark datasets (4D-Dress, Thuman2.0) show that our approach achieves better rendering quality and layer decomposition and recomposition than the previous state-of-the-art, enabling realistic virtual try-on under novel viewpoints and poses, and advancing practical creation of high-fidelity 3D human assets for immersive applications.

In this work, we introduce VideoAR, the first large-scale Visual Autoregressive (VAR) framework for video generation that combines multi-scale next-frame prediction with autoregressive modeling. VideoAR disentangles spatial and temporal dependencies by integrating intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction, supported by a 3D multi-scale tokenizer that efficiently encodes spatio-temporal dynamics. To improve long-term consistency, we propose Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask, which collectively mitigate error propagation and stabilize temporal coherence. Our multi-stage pretraining pipeline progressively aligns spatial and temporal learning across increasing resolutions and durations. Empirically, VideoAR achieves new state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models, improving FVD on UCF-101 from 99.5 to 88.6 while reducing inference steps by over 10x, and reaching a VBench score of 81.74-competitive with diffusion-based models an order of magnitude larger.

While prior studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at the photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize foundation models as a pseudo geometry prior and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal contexts, and compensating for the limitations of single-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGeoSurDepth\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u73af\u89c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f2a\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8054\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728DDAD\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u5149\u5ea6\u5c42\u9762\u65bd\u52a0\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8f83\u5c11\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u5355\u76ee\u548c\u73af\u89c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "GeoSurDepth\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f2a\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u57283D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u57282D\u4e2d\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7269\u4f53\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u7fd8\u66f2\u5b9e\u73b02D-3D\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5149\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8054\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u5728DDAD\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGeoSurDepth\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Code at: https://github.com/taozh2017/BCSI", "summary": "Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is an effective method for addressing scenarios with limited labeled data. Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels.

In this work, we probe the layer-wise generation dynamics that drive hallucinations and propose a training-free mitigation strategy. Employing the Logit Lens, we examine how LVLMs construct next-token distributions across decoder layers, uncovering a pronounced commitment-depth gap: truthful tokens accumulate probability mass on their final candidates earlier than hallucinatory ones. Drawing on this discovery, we introduce Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a lightweight method that harnesses the hidden state of the last input token-the context embedding-as a grounding signal to maintain visual fidelity throughout decoding and curb hallucinations. Evaluated on the CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with a maximum token length of 512), CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs, with its dynamic variant yielding the lowest overall hallucination rates. By integrating novel mechanistic insights with a scalable intervention, this work advances the mitigation of hallucinations in LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565Context Embedding Injection\uff08CEI\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5404\u5c42\u7684\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u653e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4f7f\u7528Logit Lens\u5206\u6790LVLM\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5404\u5c42\u7684token\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u771f\u5b9etoken\u6bd4\u5e7b\u89c9token\u66f4\u65e9\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51faContext Embedding Injection\uff08CEI\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u5373\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u6ce8\u5165\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u5728CHAI R\u3001AMBER\u548cMMHal-Bench\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cdLVLM\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cCEI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793aLVLM\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6027\u89c4\u5f8b\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits remarkable zero-shot capabilities, existing SAM-based methods rely on simple adapter fine-tuning while overlooking frequency-domain information that encodes domain-invariant features, resulting in degraded generalization under illumination and contrast variations. Furthermore, SAM's direct upsampling inevitably loses fine vessel details. To address these limitations, we propose WaveRNet, a wavelet-guided frequency learning framework for robust multi-source domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we devise a Spectral-guided Domain Modulator (SDM) that integrates wavelet decomposition with learnable domain tokens, enabling the separation of illumination-robust low-frequency structures from high-frequency vessel boundaries while facilitating domain-specific feature generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Frequency-Adaptive Domain Fusion (FADF) module that performs intelligent test-time domain selection through wavelet-based frequency similarity and soft-weighted fusion. Finally, we present a Hierarchical Mask-Prompt Refiner (HMPR) that overcomes SAM's upsampling limitation through coarse-to-fine refinement with long-range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments under the Leave-One-Domain-Out protocol on four public retinal datasets demonstrate that WaveRNet achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance.
