This includes fields such as social, political, and psychological research, where the goal is to model group dynamics and social behavior. However, current LLM agents often lack the psychological depth and consistency needed to capture the real patterns of human thinking. They usually provide direct or statistically likely answers, but they miss the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive real human interactions. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. In the proposed system, each agent is divided into three ego states - Parent, Adult, and Child. The ego states are treated as separate knowledge structures with their own perspectives and reasoning styles. To enrich their response process, they have access to an information retrieval mechanism that allows them to retrieve relevant contextual information from their vector stores. This architecture is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario, comparing agents with and without information retrieval. The results are promising and open up new directions for exploring how psychologically grounded structures can enrich agent behavior. The contribution is an agent architecture that integrates Transactional Analysis theory with contextual information retrieval to enhance the realism of LLM-based multi-agent simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\uff08Transactional Analysis\uff09\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5212\u5206\u4e3aParent\u3001Adult\u548cChild\u4e09\u79cd\u81ea\u6211\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5fc3\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u601d\u7ef4\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u52a8\u673a\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5305\u542bParent\u3001Adult\u548cChild\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5404\u5177\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u5b58\u50a8\u652f\u6301\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u4e30\u5bcc\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u5fc3\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Most existing studies rely on evolutionary update rules or value-based reinforcement learning methods. These approaches struggle to represent payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations. This work introduces Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) into spatial public goods games for the first time. In these games, individual returns are intrinsically coupled through overlapping group interactions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) treats agents as independent learners and ignores this coupling during value estimation. MAPPO addresses this limitation through a centralized critic that evaluates joint strategy configurations. To study neighborhood-level cooperation signals under this framework, we propose MAPPO with Local Cooperation Reward, termed MAPPO-LCR. The local cooperation reward aligns policy updates with surrounding cooperative density without altering the original game structure. MAPPO-LCR preserves decentralized execution while enabling population-level value estimation during training. Extensive simulations demonstrate stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence across enhancement factors. Statistical analyses further confirm the learning advantage of MAPPO over PPO in spatial public goods games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08MAPPO\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5171\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMAPPO-LCR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5408\u4f5c\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u6d8c\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u539f\u59cb\u535a\u5f08\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6f14\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u523b\u753b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4ea4\u4e92\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u8026\u5408\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165MAPPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u8054\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faMAPPO-LCR\uff0c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u5408\u4f5c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6267\u884c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMAPPO-LCR\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u4fc3\u6210\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u53ef\u9760\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MAPPO\u76f8\u8f83PPO\u5728\u8be5\u7c7b\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "MAPPO\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53MAPPO-LCR\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5171\u54c1\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u8026\u5408\u4e0e\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u5408\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Golovach", "Souvik Saha", "Sanjay Seetharaman", "Anannya Upasana"], "title": "Line Cover and Related Problems", "comment": "Accepted to STACS 2026", "summary": "We study extensions of the classic \\emph{Line Cover} problem, which asks whether a set of $n$ points in the plane can be covered using $k$ lines. Line Cover is known to be NP-hard, and we focus on two natural generalizations. The first is \\textbf{Line Clustering}, where the goal is to find $k$ lines minimizing the sum of squared distances from the input points to their nearest line. The second is \\textbf{Hyperplane Cover}, which asks whether $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ can be covered by $k$ hyperplanes.\n  We also study the more general \\textbf{Projective Clustering} problem, which unifies both settings and has applications in machine learning, data analysis, and computational geometry. In this problem, one seeks $k$ affine subspaces of dimension $r$ that minimize the sum of squared distances from the given points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ to the nearest subspace.\n  Our results reveal notable differences in the parameterized complexity of these problems. While Line Cover is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by $k$, we show that Line Clustering is W[1]-hard with respect to $k$ and does not admit an algorithm with running time $n^{o(k)}$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails. Hyperplane Cover is NP-hard even for $d=2$, and prior work of Langerman and Morin [Discrete & Computational Geometry, 2005] showed that it is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by both $k$ and $d$. We complement this by proving that Hyperplane Cover is W[2]-hard when parameterized by $k$ alone.\n  Finally, we present an algorithm for Projective Clustering running in $n^{O(dk(r+1))}$ time. This bound matches our lower bound for Line Clustering and generalizes the classic algorithm for $k$-Means Clustering ($r=0$) by Inaba, Katoh, and Imai [SoCG 1994].", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178Line Cover\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u82e5\u5e72\u63a8\u5e7f\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ecLine Clustering\u3001Hyperplane Cover\u548c\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684Projective Clustering\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "Line Cover\u95ee\u9898\u662fNP\u96be\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u81ea\u7136\u63a8\u5e7f\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u5e7f\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u53c2\u6570k\uff08\u4ee5\u53cad\u3001r\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u65b0\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8W[1]-hardness\u3001W[2]-hardness\u53ca\u6307\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u5047\u8bbe\uff08ETH\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9Projective Clustering\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "1.

Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u56fe\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5c40\u90e8\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d44\u6e90\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u867d\u80fd\u8868\u8fbe\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b8c\u5168\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u82e5\u5e72\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5224\u65ad\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7ec4\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u6216\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\u53d7\u9650\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u7406\u5047\u8bbe\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u3001\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6784\u5efa\u6269\u5c55\u56fe\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u9762\u5411\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5f0f\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

These workflows generate rapidly expanding contexts that must be curated, transformed, and compressed to maintain fidelity, avoid attention dilution, and reduce inference cost. Prior work on summarization and query-aware compression largely ignores the multi-step, plan-aware nature of agentic reasoning. In this work, we introduce PAACE (Plan-Aware Automated Context Engineering), a unified framework for optimizing the evolving state of LLM agents through next-k-task relevance modeling, plan-structure analysis, instruction co-refinement, and function-preserving compression. PAACE comprises (1) PAACE-Syn, a large-scale generator of synthetic agent workflows annotated with stepwise compression supervision, and (2) PAACE-FT, a family of distilled, plan-aware compressors trained from successful teacher demonstrations. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks (AppWorld, OfficeBench, and 8-Objective QA) demonstrate that PAACE consistently improves agent correctness while substantially reducing context load. On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than all baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency. On OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, PAACE improves both accuracy and F1, achieving fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency.

Despite these advantages, it has seldom been studied. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of this construction. From a theoretical perspective, we show how the persistence diagrams associated with the Delaunay-Rips filtration approximate those obtained with the Rips filtration. Additionally, we describe the instabilities of the Delaunay-Rips persistence diagrams when the input point cloud is perturbed. Finally, we introduce an algorithm that computes persistence diagrams of Delaunay-Rips filtrations in any dimension. We show that our method is faster and has a lower memory footprint than traditional approaches in low dimensions.

New sensors and classification approaches like TLS and deep learning achieve state-of-the art accuracy but their decision processes remain unclear. Methods such as Finer-CAM (Class Activation Mapping) can highlight features in TLS projections that contribute to the classification of a target species, yet are uncommon in similar looking contrastive tree species. We propose a novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features to systemically evaluate which features drive species discrimination. Using TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European tree species, we trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, reaching a mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis of 630 saliency maps shows the models primarily rely on crown features in TLS projections for species classification. While this result is pronounced in Silver Birch, European Beech, English oak, and Norway spruce, stem features contribute more frequently to the differentiation of European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir.

We introduce a method that approaches video generation in a filmmaker-like manner. Instead of creating a video in one step, our proposed pipeline first uses a large language model to generate a detailed production script. This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation. Furthermore, we analyze cultural disparities in current models, revealing distinct biases in subject consistency and dynamic degree between Indian vs Western-themed generations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u751f\u6210\u5267\u672c\u3001\u518d\u521b\u5efa\u89d2\u8272\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u9010\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u4e3b\u9898\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u957f\u4e14\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6545\u4e8b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u89d2\u8272\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u7535\u5f71\u5236\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u5267\u672c\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89d2\u8272\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u951a\u70b9\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u4ece7.99\u9aa4\u964d\u81f30.55\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u4e0e\u897f\u65b9\u4e3b\u9898\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6587\u5316\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5267\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u70b9\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dAI\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6587\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, real-world queries are often relational, seeking to understand how entities are associated. In this work, we introduce relation-centric KGQA, a complementary setting where the answer is a subgraph capturing the semantic connections among entities rather than an individual entity. The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. The reward function is designed to encourage compact and specific subgraphs with more informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities. Extensive experiments show that UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward over Vanilla baselines and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\uff08relation-centric KGQA\uff09\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b50\u56fe\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u5b9e\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6UniRel-R1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u526a\u679d\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfKGQA\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5355\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e3a\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u5e38\u662f\u5173\u7cfb\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u72ec\u7279\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\u5b50\u56fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniRel-R1\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5b50\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u56fe\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u9f13\u52b1\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u5177\u4f53\u3001\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4f4e\u5ea6\u4e2d\u95f4\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUniRel-R1\u5728\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5173\u7cfb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684KGQA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0cUniRel-R1\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03LLM\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5b50\u56fe\u7b54\u6848\u3002"}}

Yet, the inherent complexity and variable information density of videos present a significant bottleneck for current tokenizers, which rigidly compress all content at a fixed rate, leading to redundancy or information loss. Drawing inspiration from Shannon's information theory, this paper introduces InfoTok, a principled framework for adaptive video tokenization. We rigorously prove that existing data-agnostic training methods are suboptimal in representation length, and present a novel evidence lower bound (ELBO)-based algorithm that approaches theoretical optimality. Leveraging this framework, we develop a transformer-based adaptive compressor that enables adaptive tokenization. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art compression performance, saving 20% tokens without influence on performance, and achieving 2.3x compression rates while still outperforming prior heuristic adaptive approaches. By allocating tokens according to informational richness, InfoTok enables a more compressed yet accurate tokenization for video representation, offering valuable insights for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faInfoTok\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u8bcd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ELBO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c1120%\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u57282.3\u500d\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\uff1b\u53d7\u9999\u519c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u66f4\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInfoTok\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8868\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6b21\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0b\u754c\uff08ELBO\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u8bcd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eInfoTok\u5728\u8282\u770120%\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u57282.3\u500d\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "InfoTok\u901a\u8fc7\u4f9d\u636e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u800c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u8bcd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Assigning a utility to each possible interaction history forces us to confront the ambiguity that some hypotheses in the agent's belief distribution only predict a finite prefix of the history, which is sometimes interpreted as implying a chance of death equal to a quantity called the semimeasure loss. This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level.

While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling.

One promising approach is implementing skill libraries that allow agents to learn, validate, and apply new skills. However, current skill library approaches rely primarily on LLM prompting, making consistent skill library implementation challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards.

Yet, existing satellite-based disturbance products remain too coarse to detect changes at the scale of individual trees, typically below 100 m$^{2}$. Here, we introduce FORMSpoT (Forest Mapping with SPOT Time series), a decade-long (2014-2024) nationwide mapping of forest canopy height at 1.5 m resolution, together with annual disturbance polygons (FORMSpoT-$\u0394$) covering mainland France. Canopy heights were derived from annual SPOT-6/7 composites using a hierarchical transformer model (PVTv2) trained on high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. To enable robust change detection across heterogeneous acquisitions, we developed a dedicated post-processing pipeline combining co-registration and spatio-temporal total variation denoising. Validation against ALS revisits across 19 sites and 5,087 National Forest Inventory plots shows that FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ substantially outperforms existing disturbance products. In mountainous forests, where disturbances are small and spatially fragmented, FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ achieves an F1-score of 0.44, representing an order of magnitude higher than existing benchmarks. By enabling tree-level monitoring of forest dynamics at national scale, FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ provides a unique tool to analyze management practices, detect early signals of forest decline, and better quantify carbon losses from subtle disturbances such as thinning or selective logging. These results underscore the critical importance of sustaining very high-resolution satellite missions like SPOT and open-data initiatives such as DINAMIS for monitoring forests under climate change.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FORMSpoT\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eSPOT-6/7\u5f71\u50cf\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8fbe1.5\u7c73\u7684\u6cd5\u56fd\u5168\u56fd\u68ee\u6797\u51a0\u5c42\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5341\u5e74\uff082014\u20132024\uff09\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u5957\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5e74\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u4ea7\u54c1FORMSpoT-\u0394\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5c42\u6b21\u5316Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff08PVTv2\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u8f7d\u6fc0\u5149\u626b\u63cf\uff08ALS\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u51a0\u5c42\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cFORMSpoT-\u0394\u5728\u5c71\u533a\u7b49\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0bF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.44\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u68ee\u6797\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u78b3\u6c47\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b27\u6d32\u68ee\u6797\u78b3\u6c47\u80fd\u529b\u8fd1\u671f\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7a7a\u95f4\u663e\u5f0f\u4e14\u9ad8\u9891\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\uff1b\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4ea7\u54c1\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5355\u682a\u6811\u6728\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff08\u901a\u5e38\u5c0f\u4e8e100\u5e73\u65b9\u7c73\uff09\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u75282014\u20132024\u5e74SPOT-6/7\u5e74\u5ea6\u5408\u6210\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8ePVTv2\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u673a\u8f7d\u6fc0\u5149\u626b\u63cf\uff08ALS\uff09\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53cd\u6f141.5\u7c73\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u51a0\u5c42\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff1b\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u5305\u542b\u914d\u51c6\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u5168\u53d8\u5206\u53bb\u566a\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u5f02\u8d28\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e74\u5ea6\u6270\u52a8\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u4ea7\u54c1FORMSpoT-\u0394\u3002", "result": "\u572819\u4e2aALS\u91cd\u8bbf\u7ad9\u70b9\u548c5,087\u4e2a\u6cd5\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u68ee\u6797\u6e05\u67e5\u6837\u5730\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\uff0cFORMSpoT-\u0394\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6270\u52a8\u4ea7\u54c1\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u7ec6\u788e\u7684\u5c71\u5730\u68ee\u6797\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176F1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe0.44\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u9ad8\u51fa\u8fd1\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "FORMSpoT-\u0394\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ea7\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5355\u6728\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u68ee\u6797\u7ecf\u8425\u5b9e\u8df5\u3001\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u68ee\u6797\u8870\u9000\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ca\u91cf\u5316\u95f4\u4f10\u6216\u62e9\u4f10\u7b49\u5fae\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u78b3\u635f\u5931\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u652f\u6301SPOT\u7b49\u751a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u4efb\u52a1\u53caDINAMIS\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u8ba1\u5212\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

However, existing MMRAG methods fail to clarify the reasoning logic behind retrieval and response generation, which limits the explainability of the results. To address this gap, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning into multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models through a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework to achieve explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation. Specifically, in the first stage, rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning is employed to perform coarse-grained point-wise ranking of multi-modal documents, effectively filtering out those that are significantly irrelevant. In the second stage, reasoning-based reinforcement fine-tuning is utilized to jointly optimize fine-grained list-wise ranking and answer generation, guiding multi-modal large language models to output explainable reasoning logic in the MMRAG process.

Despite the significant progress in this field, there is still a largely unanswered research question: \"How can we quantitatively assess the similarity of a synthetically generated set of images with a set of real images in a given application domain?\". Today, answers to this question are mainly provided via user evaluation studies, inception-based measures, and the classification performance achieved on synthetic images. This paper proposes a novel measure to assess the similarity between synthetically generated and real sets of images, in terms of their utility for the development of DL-based CDS systems. Inspired by generalized neural additive models, and unlike inception-based measures, the proposed measure is interpretable (Interpretable Utility Similarity, IUS), explaining why a synthetic dataset could be more useful than another one in the context of a CDS system based on clinically relevant image features. The experimental results on publicly available datasets from various color medical imaging modalities including endoscopic, dermoscopic and fundus imaging, indicate that selecting synthetic images of high utility similarity using IUS can result in relative improvements of up to 54.6% in terms of classification performance. The generality of IUS for synthetic data assessment is demonstrated also for greyscale X-ray and ultrasound imaging modalities.

First, UmniBench can assess the understanding, generation, and editing ability within a single evaluation process. Based on human-examined prompts and QA pairs, UmniBench leverages UMM itself to evaluate its generation and editing ability with its understanding ability. This simple but effective paradigm allows comprehensive evaluation of UMMs. Second, UmniBench covers 13 major domains and more than 200 concepts, ensuring a thorough inspection of UMMs. Moreover, UmniBench can also decouple and separately evaluate understanding, generation, and editing abilities, providing a fine-grained assessment.

Project page: https://junyingw.github.io/paper/dgh", "summary": "The creation of photorealistic dynamic hair remains a major challenge in digital human modeling because of the complex motions, occlusions, and light scattering. Existing methods often resort to static capture and physics-based models that do not scale as they require manual parameter fine-tuning to handle the diversity of hairstyles and motions, and heavy computation to obtain high-quality appearance. In this paper, we present Dynamic Gaussian Hair (DGH), a novel framework that efficiently learns hair dynamics and appearance. We propose: (1) a coarse-to-fine model that learns temporally coherent hair motion dynamics across diverse hairstyles; (2) a strand-guided optimization module that learns a dynamic 3D Gaussian representation for hair appearance with support for differentiable rendering, enabling gradient-based learning of view-consistent appearance under motion. Unlike prior simulation-based pipelines, our approach is fully data-driven, scales with training data, and generalizes across various hairstyles and head motion sequences. Additionally, DGH can be seamlessly integrated into a 3D Gaussian avatar framework, enabling realistic, animatable hair for high-fidelity avatar representation.

Even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. We propose a speculation-and-correction framework that adapts the predict-then-verify philosophy of speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning. When a new observation arrives, the system measures the mismatch between the encoded real latent state and the queued predicted latent. For small to moderate mismatch, a lightweight learned corrector applies a residual update to the speculative action, distilled offline from a replanning teacher. For large mismatch, the agent safely falls back to full replanning and clears stale action queues. We study both a gated two-tower MLP corrector and a temporal Transformer corrector to address local errors and systematic drift. Experiments on the DMC Humanoid-Walk task show that our method reduces the number of planning inferences from 500 to 282, improves end-to-end step latency by 25 percent, and maintains strong control performance with only a 7.1 percent return reduction. Ablation results demonstrate that speculative execution without correction is unreliable over longer horizons, highlighting the necessity of mismatch-aware correction for robust latency reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08TD-MPC2\uff09\u7684\u201c\u63a8\u6d4b-\u6821\u6b63\u201d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\u961f\u5217\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u6839\u636e\u72b6\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6821\u6b63\u6216\u56de\u9000\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u89c4\u5212\u63a8\u7406\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e8f\u8d2f\u63a7\u5236\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e38\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6bcf\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u89c4\u5212\u9891\u7387\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u63a8\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\u601d\u60f3\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff1a\u6bcf\u6b65\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4MPC\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u77ed\u89c6\u754c\u52a8\u4f5c\u961f\u5217\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u5f53\u65b0\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u6765\u65f6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u771f\u5b9e\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u82e5\u504f\u5dee\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u5219\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u84b8\u998f\u81ea\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6821\u6b63\u5668\uff08MLP\u6216Transformer\uff09\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u65bd\u52a0\u6b8b\u5dee\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b\u82e5\u504f\u5dee\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u5219\u56de\u9000\u81f3\u5b8c\u6574\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u5e76\u6e05\u7a7a\u65e7\u52a8\u4f5c\u961f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728DMC Humanoid-Walk\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u89c4\u5212\u63a8\u7406\u6b21\u6570\u4ece500\u6b21\u964d\u81f3282\u6b21\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5355\u6b65\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e25%\uff0c\u4ec5\u5e26\u67657.1%\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u65e0\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u7eaf\u63a8\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u754c\u4e0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u504f\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u964d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b-\u6821\u6b63\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

To appear in Hudl Performance Insights 2025", "summary": "Transfers play a pivotal role in shaping a football club's success, yet forecasting whether a transfer will succeed remains difficult due to the strong context-dependence of on-field performance. Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEventGPT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7403\u5458\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8db3\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7403\u5458\u8f6c\u4f1a\u540e\u7684\u9002\u914d\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f6c\u4f1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u6216\u4e8b\u540e\u4ef7\u503c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7403\u5458\u5728\u65b0\u6218\u672f\u73af\u5883\u548c\u961f\u53cb\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563token\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u573a\u4e0a\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u53ca\u5176\u6b8b\u5deeOn-Ball\u4ef7\u503c\uff08rOBV\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7403\u5458\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u8d5b\u5b63\u82f1\u8d85\u8054\u8d5b\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0cEventGPT\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8f6c\u4f1a\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "EventGPT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u7403\u5458\u5728\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u914d\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u4f1a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Pok\u00e9mon battles demand reasoning about type matchups, statistical trade-offs, and risk assessment, skills that mirror human strategic thinking. This work examines whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as competent battle agents, capable of both making tactically sound decisions and generating novel, balanced game content. We developed a turn-based Pok\u00e9mon battle system where LLMs select moves based on battle state rather than pre-programmed logic. The framework captures essential Pok\u00e9mon mechanics: type effectiveness multipliers, stat-based damage calculations, and multi-Pok\u00e9mon team management. Through systematic evaluation across multiple model architectures we measured win rates, decision latency, type-alignment accuracy, and token efficiency. These results suggest LLMs can function as dynamic game opponents without domain-specific training, offering a practical alternative to reinforcement learning for turn-based strategic games. The dual capability of tactical reasoning and content creation, positions LLMs as both players and designers, with implications for procedural generation and adaptive difficulty systems in interactive entertainment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5b9d\u53ef\u68a6\u5bf9\u6218\u4e2d\u7684\u6218\u672f\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u65e0\u9700\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u6e38\u620f\u5bf9\u624b\uff0c\u5e76\u517c\u5177\u73a9\u5bb6\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u53cc\u91cd\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9d\u53ef\u68a6\u5bf9\u6218\u6d89\u53ca\u5c5e\u6027\u514b\u5236\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u6743\u8861\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u80dc\u4efb\u6218\u672f\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u65b0\u9896\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u5408\u5236\u7684\u5b9d\u53ef\u68a6\u5bf9\u6218\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8ba9LLMs\u6839\u636e\u5bf9\u6218\u72b6\u6001\u800c\u975e\u9884\u8bbe\u903b\u8f91\u9009\u62e9\u62db\u5f0f\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5c5e\u6027\u514b\u5236\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u4f24\u5bb3\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u591a\u5b9d\u53ef\u68a6\u961f\u4f0d\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u80dc\u7387\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u5339\u914d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548ctoken\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLMs\u65e0\u9700\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6e38\u620f\u5bf9\u624b\uff0c\u5728\u6218\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u80dc\u7387\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u7528\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56de\u5408\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u73a9\u5bb6\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u96be\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This is unlike common photos people can take of themselves. In this paper, we explore how to create a ``professional'' version of a person's photograph, i.e., in a chosen pose, in a simple environment, with good lighting, and standard black top/bottom clothing. A key challenge is to preserve the person's unique identity, face and body features while transforming the photo. If there would exist a large paired dataset of the same person photographed both ``in the wild'' and by a professional photographer, the problem would potentially be easier to solve. However, such data does not exist, especially for a large variety of identities. To that end, we propose two key insights: 1) Our method transforms the input photo and person's face to a canonical UV space, which is further coupled with reposing methodology to model occlusions and novel view synthesis. Operating in UV space allows us to leverage existing unpaired datasets. 2) We personalize the output photo via multi image finetuning. Our approach yields high-quality, reposed portraits and achieves strong qualitative and quantitative performance on real-world imagery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u666e\u901a\u4eba\u7269\u7167\u7247\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4e13\u4e1a\u6444\u5f71\u6548\u679c\uff08\u5982\u6807\u51c6\u59ff\u52bf\u3001\u826f\u597d\u5149\u7167\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u670d\u88c5\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4eba\u7269\u8eab\u4efd\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u5230\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u7684UV\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u59ff\u6001\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u975e\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5fae\u8c03\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u666e\u901a\u7528\u6237\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u7167\u7247\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u4e1a\u6444\u5f71\u5e08\u6240\u5177\u5907\u7684\u5149\u7ebf\u3001\u59ff\u52bf\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u7f8e\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u53c8\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u201c\u65e5\u5e38\u7167-\u4e13\u4e1a\u7167\u201d\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u7559\u8eab\u4efd\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u98ce\u683c\u4eba\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4eba\u8138\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u7684UV\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u91cd\u59ff\u6001\u6280\u672f\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u975e\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u4eba\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u7559\u8eab\u4efd\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u98ce\u683c\u4eba\u50cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728UV\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u5177\u6709\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\uff08\u5982\u51a5\u738b\u661f\u4e0d\u518d\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u884c\u661f\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u8de8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6574\u4f53\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u6240\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u53ef\u9006\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u201d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0d\u8131\u79bb\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49\u201c\u8d85\u989d\u4fe1\u606f\u201d\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u81ea\u7136\u6027\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u201c\u8fa9\u8bc1\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u201d\u9a71\u52a8\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u79cd\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e3b\u5f20\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u51fa\u73b0\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6536\u7f29\u3001\u5206\u88c2\u6216\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u534f\u8bae\u4ee5\u5c11\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u5efa\u76f8\u540c\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u6f14\u5316\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u7c7b\u4eba\u6982\u5ff5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

ARO determines the minimal opacity needed to satisfy perceptual contrast standards (WCAG 2.2) relative to the underlying background, ensuring readability while maintaining aesthetic harmony without human intervention. Multi-page consistency is maintained through a summarization-and-instruction process, where each page is distilled into a compact representation that recursively guides subsequent generations. This design reflects how humans build continuity by retaining prior context, ensuring that visual motifs evolve coherently across an entire document. Our method further treats a document as a structured composition in which text, figures, and backgrounds are preserved or regenerated as separate layers, allowing targeted background editing without compromising readability.

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies.

Infrared images and fire masks provide complementary thermal and boundary information, yet current methods are predominantly limited to binary mask modeling with inherent signal sparsity, failing to capture the complex dynamics of fire. While world models show promise in video generation, their physical inconsistencies pose significant challenges for fire forecasting. This paper introduces PhysFire-WM, a Physics-informed World Model for emulating Fire spread dynamics. Our approach internalizes combustion dynamics by encoding structured priors from a Physical Simulator to rectify physical discrepancies, coupled with a Cross-task Collaborative Training strategy (CC-Train) that alleviates the issue of limited information in mask-based modeling.

This research introduces a diagnostic chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), using GPT-4o, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and explainable AI techniques. The chatbot engages patients in a dynamic conversation, helping to extract and normalize symptoms while prioritizing potential diagnoses through similarity matching and adaptive questioning. With Chain-of-Thought prompting, the system also offers more transparent reasoning behind its diagnoses. When tested against traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, the LLM-based system delivered impressive results, achieving an accuracy of 90% and Top-3 accuracy of 100%.

However, existing methods, including Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), all rely on annotated text-to-image pairs for aligning visual and textual modalities. This dependency introduces substantial cost and accuracy requirement in preparing high-quality datasets. At the same time, processing data from two modes also requires dual-tower encoders for most models, which also hinders their lightweight. To address these limitations, we introduce a ``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training via Large-Language-Model-based Generation (LGCLIP)\" framework. LGCLIP leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate class-specific prompts that guide a diffusion model in synthesizing reference images. Afterwards these generated images serve as visual prototypes, and the visual features of real images are extracted and compared with the visual features of these prototypes to achieve comparative prediction. By optimizing prompt generation through the LLM and employing only a visual encoder, LGCLIP remains lightweight and efficient. Crucially, our framework requires only class labels as input during whole experimental procedure, eliminating the need for manually annotated image-text pairs and extra pre-processing. Experimental results validate the feasibility and efficiency of LGCLIP, demonstrating great performance in zero-shot classification tasks and establishing a novel paradigm for classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLGCLIP\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u522b\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u8981\u6c42\u4e25\u82db\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5854\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u578b\uff1b\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u539f\u578b\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLGCLIP\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LGCLIP\u4ec5\u9700\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6446\u8131\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories. However, traditional reward machines lack the ability to model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search.

However, it still struggles with compositional image-text matching, particularly in accurately associating objects with their corresponding attributes, because its inherent global representation often overlooks fine-grained semantics for attribute binding. Existing methods often require additional training or extensive hard negative sampling, yet they frequently show limited generalization to novel compositional concepts and fail to fundamentally address the drawbacks of global representations. In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we employ a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for both object and attribute phrases in the text, thereby mitigating attribute confusion and improving semantic precision. We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches. By aggregating localized similarity scores, ABE-CLIP computes the final image-text similarity. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that ABE-CLIP significantly improves attribute-object binding performance, even surpassing methods that require extensive training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed1\u5b9a\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5ABE-CLIP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u7cbe\u70bc\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u8bcd\u5143-\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u56fe\u6587\u5339\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u5c5e\u6027-\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ed1\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u56fe\u6587\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5c06\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u5176\u5c5e\u6027\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u5f81\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u96be\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u672a\u6839\u672c\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u5f81\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faABE-CLIP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u7cbe\u70bc\u673a\u5236\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u77ed\u8bed\u7684\u8bcd\u5143\u5d4c\u5165\uff09\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u8bcd\u5143-\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u70bc\u540e\u6587\u672c\u8bcd\u5143\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u56fe\u6587\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cABE-CLIP\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c5e\u6027-\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ed1\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ABE-CLIP\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u7cbe\u70bc\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86CLIP\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed1\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design. Instead, we identify a nuanced, culturally mediated landscape of human-AI interaction, which demands that we move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9879\u6db5\u76d610\u56fd\u30013500\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u5bf9AI\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e92\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u800c\u975e\u7406\u8bba\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u610f\u8bc6\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u62df\u4eba\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u666e\u904d\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u4efb\u6216\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u2014\u2014\u5176\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u6587\u5316\u663e\u8457\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u4ee5\u897f\u65b9\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u201c\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u201dAI\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5173\u4e8eAI\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u4e0d\u5f53\u4fe1\u4efb\u6216\u60c5\u611f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u5168\u7403\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3b\u6d41\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u897f\u65b9\u7406\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5168\u7403\u7528\u6237\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u4e24\u9879\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u56fd\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08N=3,500\uff09\uff0c\u8986\u76d610\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u8ba9\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4e0eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u611f\u77e5\u53ca\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u6587\u5316\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u62df\u4eba\u7a0b\u5ea6\u65f6\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3001\u5171\u60c5\u7406\u89e3\u7b49\u4e92\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u56e0\u679c\u63d0\u5347\u62df\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u666e\u904d\u63d0\u5347\u4fe1\u4efb\u6216\u53c2\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u6587\u5316\u663e\u8457\u8c03\u8282\u6548\u679c\u2014\u2014\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u5df4\u897f\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u65e5\u672c\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u9002\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53d7\u6587\u5316\u4e2d\u4ecb\u7684\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u6452\u5f03\u5355\u4e00\u6cbb\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8f6c\u5411\u66f4\u5177\u6587\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684AI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002"}}

Evaluation can be broadly grouped into objective (e.g., measuring the amount of greenery) and subjective (e.g., polling the perception of people) approaches, which may differ -- what people see and feel about how green a place is might not match the measurements of the actual amount of vegetation. In this work, we advance the state of the art by measuring such differences and explaining them through human, geographic, and spatial dimensions. The experiments rely on contextual information extracted from street view imagery and a comprehensive urban visual perception survey collected from 1,000 people across five countries with their extensive demographic and personality information. We analyze the discrepancies between objective measures (e.g., Green View Index (GVI)) and subjective scores (e.g., pairwise ratings), examining whether they can be explained by a variety of human and visual factors such as age group and spatial variation of greenery in the scene. The findings reveal that such discrepancies are comparable around the world and that demographics and personality do not play a significant role in perception. Further, while perceived and measured greenery correlate consistently across geographies (both where people and where imagery are from), where people live plays a significant role in explaining perceptual differences, with these two, as the top among seven, features that influences perceived greenery the most. This location influence suggests that cultural, environmental, and experiential factors substantially shape how individuals observe greenery in cities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6765\u81ea\u4e94\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u76841000\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u5ba2\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u7eff\u89c6\u7387GVI\uff09\u4e0e\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6700\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5ba2\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6210\u56e0\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u8272\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6db5\u76d61000\u540d\u6765\u81ea\u4e94\u56fd\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5ba2\u89c2\u7eff\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982GVI\uff09\u4e0e\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u3001\u5730\u7406\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e0e\u4e3b\u89c2\u7eff\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u4eba\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u800c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5c45\u4f4f\u5730\u662f\u89e3\u91ca\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6700\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6587\u5316\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6df1\u523b\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6240\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u6587\u5316\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u5851\u9020\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u8d77\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e94\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5730\u57df\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

The task of relative pose estimation using visual and inertial information has important applications in various fields. To improve the accuracy of relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems, we propose a globally optimal solver using affine correspondences to estimate the generalized relative pose with a known vertical direction. First, a cost function about the relative rotation angle is established after decoupling the rotation matrix and translation vector, which minimizes the algebraic error of geometric constraints from affine correspondences. Then, the global optimization problem is converted into two polynomials with two unknowns based on the characteristic equation and its first derivative is zero. Finally, the relative rotation angle can be solved using the polynomial eigenvalue solver, and the translation vector can be obtained from the eigenvector. Besides, a new linear solution is proposed when the relative rotation is small. The proposed solver is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world datasets.

However, their reliability is hindered by hallucinations, where models often fail to derive answers from visual evidence, instead relying on learned textual priors. Existing mitigation strategies for MedVLMs have distinct limitations: training-based methods rely on costly expert annotations, limiting scalability, while training-free interventions like contrastive decoding, though data-efficient, apply a global, untargeted correction whose effects in complex real-world clinical settings can be unreliable. To address these challenges, we introduce Anatomical Region-Guided Contrastive Decoding (ARCD), a plug-and-play strategy that mitigates hallucinations by providing targeted, region-specific guidance.

This paper proposes Reasoning Palette, a novel latent-modulation framework that endows the model with a stochastic latent variable for strategic contextualization, guiding its internal planning prior to token generation. This latent context is inferred from the mean-pooled embedding of a question-answer pair via a variational autoencoder (VAE), where each sampled latent potentially encodes a distinct reasoning context. During inference, a sampled latent is decoded into learnable token prefixes and prepended to the input prompt, modulating the model's internal reasoning trajectory. In this way, the model performs internal sampling over reasoning strategies prior to output generation, which shapes the style and structure of the entire response sequence. A brief supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up phase allows the model to adapt to this latent conditioning. Within RL optimization, Reasoning Palette facilitates structured exploration by enabling on-demand injection for diverse reasoning modes, significantly enhancing exploration efficiency and sustained learning capability. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method enables interpretable and controllable control over the (vision-) language model's strategic behavior, thereby achieving consistent performance gains over standard RL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faReasoning Palette\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u751f\u6210\u524d\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\uff09\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\uff09\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u5c42\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u968f\u673a\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u8be5\u53d8\u91cf\u4ece\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6c60\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684token\u524d\u7f00\uff0c\u9644\u52a0\u5230\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u524d\u4ee5\u8c03\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u77ed\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Reasoning Palette\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5185\u90e8\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\uff09\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

While reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offer a low-cost alignment solution, their reliance on sparse, outcome-based rewards inadvertently encourages models to \"overthink\" -- generating verbose, convoluted, and unverifiable Chain-of-Thought reasoning to justify answers. This focus on outcomes obscures factual errors and poses significant safety risks. To address this, we propose CheXPO-v2, a novel alignment framework that shifts from outcome to process supervision. Our core innovation is a Knowledge Graph Consistency Reward mechanism driven by Entity-Relation Matching. By explicitly parsing reasoning steps into structured \"Disease, Relation, Anatomy\" triplets, we provide fine-grained supervision that penalizes incoherent logic and hallucinations at the atomic level. Integrating this with a hard-example mining strategy, our approach significantly outperforms GRPO and state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MIMIC-CXR-VQA. Crucially, CheXPO-v2 achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy using only 5k samples, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency while producing clinically sound and verifiable reasoning.

To bridge this gap, we introduce DAVE, a vision encoder purpose-built for VLMs and tailored for these tasks. Our training pipeline is designed to leverage abundant unlabeled data to bypass the need for costly large-scale annotations for document and web images. We begin with a self-supervised pretraining stage on unlabeled images, followed by a supervised autoregressive pretraining stage, where the model learns tasks like parsing and localization from limited, high-quality data. Within the supervised stage, we adopt two strategies to improve our encoder's alignment with both general visual knowledge and diverse document and web agentic tasks: (i) We introduce a novel model-merging scheme, combining encoders trained with different text decoders to ensure broad compatibility with different web agentic architectures. (ii) We use ensemble training to fuse features from pretrained generalist encoders (e.g., SigLIP2) with our own document and web-specific representations. Extensive experiments on classic document tasks, VQAs, web localization, and agent-based benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing DAVE as a strong vision encoder for document and web applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDAVE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u6863\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7f51\u9875\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0cDAVE\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u6863\u4e0e\u7f51\u9875\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u4f4e\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6587\u6863\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7f51\u9875\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "DAVE\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6709\u9650\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u529b\uff1a(i) \u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u67b6\u6784\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff1b(ii) \u5229\u7528\u96c6\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5982SigLIP2\uff09\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6587\u6863/\u7f51\u9875\u4e13\u7528\u8868\u793a\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u6587\u6863\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\uff08VQA\uff09\u3001\u7f51\u9875\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ca\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDAVE\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9762\u5411\u6587\u6863\u4e0e\u7f51\u9875\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DAVE\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u6587\u6863\u4e0e\u7f51\u9875\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, significant discrepancies in band composition and spatial resolution across different optical sensors present major challenges for existing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). These models are typically pretrained on fixed band configurations and resolutions, making them vulnerable to real world scenarios involving missing bands, cross sensor fusion, and unseen spatial scales, thereby limiting their generalization and practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose Any Optical Model (AOM), a universal RSFM explicitly designed to accommodate arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolution scales. To preserve distinctive spectral characteristics even when bands are missing or newly introduced, AOM introduces a spectrum-independent tokenizer that assigns each channel a dedicated band embedding, enabling explicit encoding of spectral identity. To effectively capture texture and contextual patterns from sub-meter to hundred-meter imagery, we design a multi-scale adaptive patch embedding mechanism that dynamically modulates the receptive field. Furthermore, to maintain global semantic consistency across varying resolutions, AOM incorporates a multi-scale semantic alignment mechanism alongside a channel-wise self-supervised masking and reconstruction pretraining strategy that jointly models spectral-spatial relationships. Extensive experiments on over 10 public datasets, including those from Sentinel-2, Landsat, and HLS, demonstrate that AOM consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under challenging conditions such as band missing, cross sensor, and cross resolution settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAny Optical Model (AOM)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6ce2\u6bb5\u3001\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u591a\u6e90\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u53ca\u672a\u77e5\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "AOM\u5f15\u5165\u5149\u8c31\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u5404\u901a\u9053\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u8eab\u4efd\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5d4c\u5165\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff1b\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u7ea7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5149\u8c31-\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u62ecSentinel-2\u3001Landsat\u548cHLS\u5728\u5185\u768410\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAOM\u5728\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b49\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AOM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u5149\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

A critical failure mode is \"visual forgetting\", where models progressively lose visual grounding as reasoning extends, a phenomenon aptly described as \"think longer, see less\". We posit this failure stems from current training paradigms prematurely entangling two distinct cognitive skills: (1) abstract logical reasoning \"how-to-think\") and (2) strategic visual perception (\"when-to-look\"). This creates a foundational cold-start deficiency -- weakening abstract reasoning -- and a strategic perception deficit, as models lack a policy for when to perceive. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum-based framework to disentangle these skills. First, we introduce a disentangled Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that builds a robust abstract reasoning backbone on text-only data before anchoring it to vision with a novel Perception-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (PG-CoT) paradigm. Second, we resolve the strategic perception deficit by formulating timing as a reinforcement learning problem. We design a Pivotal Perception Reward that teaches the model when to look by coupling perceptual actions to linguistic markers of cognitive uncertainty (e.g., \"wait\", \"verify\"), thereby learning an autonomous grounding policy. Our contributions include the formalization of these two deficiencies and the development of a principled, two-stage framework to address them, transforming the model from a heuristic-driven observer to a strategic, grounded reasoner. \\textbf{Code}: \\url{https://github.com/gaozilve-max/learning-when-to-look}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u62bd\u8c61\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u94fe\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u201c\u89c6\u89c9\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u957f\u94fe\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u8fc7\u65e9\u5730\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f55\u65f6\u67e5\u770b\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5728\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u4e3b\u5e72\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u611f\u77e5\u951a\u5b9a\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08PG-CoT\uff09\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5c06\u201c\u4f55\u65f6\u770b\u201d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5173\u952e\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\uff08Pivotal Perception Reward\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6807\u8bb0\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u201c\u89c6\u89c9\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u6218\u7565\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8005\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u4e0e\u6218\u7565\u611f\u77e5\u7f3a\u5931\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u94fe\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

While existing methods attempt to address these issues by reducing visual tokens or extending model's context length, they may miss useful information or take considerable computation. In fact, when answering given questions, only a small amount of crucial information is required. Therefore, we propose an efficient question-aware memory mechanism, enabling MLLMs to recurrently seek these critical clues. Our approach, named VideoDetective, simplifies this task by iteratively processing video sub-segments. For each sub-segment, a question-aware compression strategy is employed by introducing a few special memory tokens to achieve purposefully compression. This allows models to effectively seek critical clues while reducing visual tokens. Then, due to history context could have a significant impact, we recurrently aggregate and store these memory tokens to update history context, which would be reused for subsequent sub-segments. Furthermore, to more effectively measure model's long video understanding ability, we introduce GLVC (Grounding Long Video Clues), a long video question-answering dataset, which features grounding critical and concrete clues scattered throughout entire videos. Experimental results demonstrate our method enables MLLMs with limited context length of 32K to efficiently process 100K tokens (3600 frames, an hour-long video sampled at 1fps), requiring only 2 minutes and 37GB GPU memory usage. Evaluation results across multiple long video benchmarks illustrate our method can more effectively seek critical clues from massive information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVideoDetective\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u611f\u77e5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u9891\u5b50\u7247\u6bb5\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u6b8a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee4\u724c\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u76ee\u7684\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f7f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\uff08LVQA\uff09\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e9e\u5927\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u8f7d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u7b54\u53ea\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u5173\u952e\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVideoDetective\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6bb5\u8fed\u4ee3\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6bcf\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u95ee\u7b54\u611f\u77e5\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u7279\u6b8a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee4\u724c\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u76ee\u7684\u538b\u7f29\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u805a\u5408\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee4\u724c\u66f4\u65b0\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4f9b\u540e\u7eed\u7247\u6bb5\u590d\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ec532K\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406100K tokens\uff08\u53731\u5c0f\u65f61fps\u91c7\u6837\u76843600\u5e27\u89c6\u9891\uff09\uff0c\u8017\u65f62\u5206\u949f\u3001\u663e\u5b5837GB\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u4ece\u6d77\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5173\u952e\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u7b54\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MLLMs\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u5957\u53d1\u5e03\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6GLVC\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u6563\u5173\u952e\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, most prior benchmarks rely on low-resolution imagery, and some high-resolution benchmarks suffer from flawed reasoning-task designs. We show that text-only LLMs can perform competitively with multimodal vision-language models on RS reasoning tasks without access to images, revealing a critical mismatch between current benchmarks and the intended evaluation of visual understanding. To enable faithful assessment, we introduce RSHR-Bench, a super-high-resolution benchmark for RS visual understanding and reasoning. RSHR-Bench contains 5,329 full-scene images with a long side of at least 4,000 pixels, with up to about 3 x 10^8 pixels per image, sourced from widely used RS corpora and UAV collections. We design four task families: multiple-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, image captioning, and single-image evaluation. These tasks cover nine perception categories and four reasoning types, supporting multi-turn and multi-image dialog. To reduce reliance on language priors, we apply adversarial filtering with strong LLMs followed by rigorous human verification. Overall, we construct 3,864 VQA tasks, 3,913 image captioning tasks, and 500 fully human-written or verified single-image evaluation VQA pairs. Evaluations across open-source, closed-source, and RS-specific VLMs reveal persistent performance gaps in super-high-resolution scenarios.

Yet existing methods rely on intermediate representations such as keypoints or trajectories, introducing information loss and cumulative errors that harm temporal and visual consistency. We present Mitty, a Diffusion Transformer that enables video In-Context Learning for end-to-end Human2Robot video generation. Built on a pretrained video diffusion model, Mitty leverages strong visual-temporal priors to translate human demonstrations into robot-execution videos without action labels or intermediate abstractions. Demonstration videos are compressed into condition tokens and fused with robot denoising tokens through bidirectional attention during diffusion. To mitigate paired-data scarcity, we also develop an automatic synthesis pipeline that produces high-quality human-robot pairs from large egocentric datasets. Experiments on Human2Robot and EPIC-Kitchens show that Mitty delivers state-of-the-art results, strong generalization to unseen environments, and new insights for scalable robot learning from human observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mitty \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u793a\u8303\u89c6\u9891\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u6216\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5728 Human2Robot \u548c EPIC-Kitchens \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u6216\u8f68\u8ff9\u7b49\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u793a\u8303\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u907f\u514d\u4e2d\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Mitty\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684 Diffusion Transformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u793a\u8303\u6761\u4ef6 token \u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53bb\u566a token \u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728 Human2Robot \u548c EPIC-Kitchens \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97 SOTA \u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "Mitty \u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef Human2Robot \u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u793a\u8303\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing medical VQA datasets are limited in scale, dominated by X-ray imaging or biomedical illustrations, and often prone to text-based shortcuts. RadImageNet-VQA is built from expert-curated annotations and provides 750K images paired with 7.5M question-answer samples. It covers three key tasks - abnormality detection, anatomy recognition, and pathology identification - spanning eight anatomical regions and 97 pathology categories, and supports open-ended, closed-ended, and multiple-choice questions. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art vision-language models still struggle with fine-grained pathology identification, particularly in open-ended settings and even after fine-tuning. Text-only analysis further reveals that model performance collapses to near-random without image inputs, confirming that RadImageNet-VQA is free from linguistic shortcuts.

We propose AnyCXR, a unified framework that enables generalizable multi-organ segmentation across arbitrary CXR projection angles using only synthetic supervision. The method combines a Multi-stage Domain Randomization (MSDR) engine, which generates over 100,000 anatomically faithful and highly diverse synthetic radiographs from 3D CT volumes, with a Conditional Joint Annotation Regularization (CAR) learning strategy that leverages partial and imperfect labels by enforcing anatomical consistency in a latent space. Trained entirely on synthetic data, AnyCXR achieves strong zero-shot generalization on multiple real-world datasets, providing accurate delineation of 54 anatomical structures in PA, lateral, and oblique views. The resulting segmentation maps support downstream clinical tasks, including automated cardiothoracic ratio estimation, spine curvature assessment, and disease classification, where the incorporation of anatomical priors improves diagnostic performance.

Our method begins with a 4D aware mask generation module that reconstructs the scene geometry and propagates user specified object placement across frames while maintaining temporal coherence and occlusion consistency. Building upon this spatial foundation, we extend a diffusion based video generation model to jointly synthesize the inserted object and its surrounding local variations such as illumination and shading. To enable supervised training, we introduce ROSE++, an illumination aware synthetic dataset constructed by transforming the ROSE object removal dataset into triplets of object removed video, object present video, and a VLM generated reference image.

Existing robust MLLMs predominantly rely on implicit training/adaptation that focuses solely on visual encoder generalization, suffering from limited interpretability and isolated optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust-R1, a novel framework that explicitly models visual degradations through structured reasoning chains. Our approach integrates: (i) supervised fine-tuning for degradation-aware reasoning foundations, (ii) reward-driven alignment for accurately perceiving degradation parameters, and (iii) dynamic reasoning depth scaling adapted to degradation intensity. To facilitate this approach, we introduce a specialized 11K dataset featuring realistic degradations synthesized across four critical real-world visual processing stages, each annotated with structured chains connecting degradation parameters, perceptual influence, pristine semantic reasoning chain, and conclusion.

However, current methods mainly focus on handling humans wearing tight clothing and perform poorly when estimating body shapes and poses under diverse clothing, especially loose garments. To this end, we make two key insights: (1) tailoring clothing to fit the human body can mitigate the adverse impact of clothing on 3D human mesh recovery, and (2) utilizing human visual information from large foundational models can enhance the generalization ability of the estimation. Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images. Additionally, a web application for online fashion and shopping powered by ClothHMR is developed, illustrating that ClothHMR can effectively serve real-world usage scenarios.

However, previous approaches often struggle to effectively leverage both the visual and linguistic knowledge. Recent efforts have attempted to incorporate Vision-language models (VLMs), which excel at aligning visual and textual features, into universal IR. Nevertheless, these methods fail to utilize the linguistic priors to ensure semantic coherence during the restoration process. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Vision-Language Model Guided Image Restoration (VLMIR) framework, which leverages the rich vision-language priors of VLMs, such as CLIP, to enhance IR performance through improved visual perception and semantic understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: VLM-based feature extraction and diffusion-based image restoration. In the first stage, we extract complementary visual and linguistic representations of input images by condensing the visual perception and high-level semantic priors through VLMs. Specifically, we align the embeddings of captions from low-quality and high-quality images using a cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employ a degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean image content embeddings. These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific IR tasks, underscoring the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs in advancing image restoration capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVLMIR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u7528\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u9000\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u6062\u590d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7VLM\u63d0\u53d6\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u9f50\u9ad8\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u9000\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u9000\u5316\u4e0e\u5e72\u51c0\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u9000\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Depending on the brain tumor type, the FLAIR hyperintensity volume is an important measure to asses the tumor volume or surrounding edema, and an automatic segmentation of this would be useful in the clinic. In this study, around 5000 FLAIR images of various tumors types and acquisition time points from different centers were used to train a unified FLAIR hyperintensity segmentation model using an Attention U-Net architecture. The performance was compared against dataset specific models, and was validated on different tumor types, acquisition time points and against BraTS. The unified model achieved an average Dice score of 88.65\\% for pre-operative meningiomas, 80.08% for pre-operative metastasis, 90.92% for pre-operative and 84.60% for post-operative gliomas from BraTS, and 84.47% for pre-operative and 61.27\\% for post-operative lower grade gliomas. In addition, the results showed that the unified model achieved comparable segmentation performance to the dataset specific models on their respective datasets, and enables generalization across tumor types and acquisition time points, which facilitates the deployment in a clinical setting.

To address these challenges, we present HiSIR-Net, a High resolution, Self-supervised Reconstruction framework for pixel-wise PCBA localization. Our design combines two lightweight modules that make this practical on real 4K-resolution boards: (i) a Selective Input-Reconstruction Gate (SIR-Gate) that lets the model decide where to trust reconstruction versus the original input, thereby reducing irrelevant reconstruction artifacts and false alarms; and (ii) a Region-level Optimized Patch Selection (ROPS) scheme with positional cues to select overlapping patch reconstructions coherently across arbitrary resolutions. Organically integrating these mechanisms yields clean, high-resolution anomaly maps with low false positive (FP) rate. To bridge the gap in high-resolution PCBA datasets, we further contribute a self-collected dataset named SIPCBA-500 of 500 images. We conduct extensive experiments on our SIPCBA-500 as well as public benchmarks, demonstrating the superior localization performance of our method while running at practical speed.

However, progress has been limited by the absence of public datasets and standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are often not directly comparable, as they use private data and inconsistent evaluation frameworks. To address this, we present MGRegBench, a public benchmark dataset for mammogram registration. It comprises over 5,000 image pairs, with 100 containing manual anatomical landmarks and segmentation masks for rigorous evaluation. This makes MGRegBench one of the largest public 2D registration datasets with manual annotations. Using this resource, we benchmarked diverse registration methods including classical (ANTs), learning-based (VoxelMorph, TransMorph), implicit neural representation (IDIR), a classic mammography-specific approach, and a recent state-of-the-art deep learning method MammoRegNet. The implementations were adapted to this modality from the authors' implementations or re-implemented from scratch. Our contributions are: (1) the first public dataset of this scale with manual landmarks and masks for mammography registration; (2) the first like-for-like comparison of diverse methods on this modality; and (3) an extensive analysis of deep learning-based registration.

While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faProCache\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u5b58\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901fDiffusion Transformers\uff08DiT\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "Diffusion Transformers\uff08DiT\uff09\u867d\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7f13\u5b58\u95f4\u9694\u56fa\u5b9a\u3001\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e25\u91cd\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94DiT\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProCache\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(i) \u4e00\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u6a21\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u7ea6\u675f\u91c7\u6837\u751f\u6210\u5951\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u6027\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8c03\u5ea6\uff1b(ii) \u4e00\u4e2a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u7f13\u5b58\u6bb5\u5185\u5bf9\u6df1\u5c42\u5757\u548c\u9ad8\u91cd\u8981\u6027token\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5f00\u9500\u7f13\u89e3\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "result": "\u5728PixArt-alpha\u548cDiT\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cProCache\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad81.96\u500d\u548c2.90\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u635f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ProCache\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u5b58\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DiT\u52a0\u901f\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto choice in modern systems and achieves this by contrasting conditional and unconditional samples. Recent work explores contrasting negative samples at inference using a weaker model, via strong/weak model pairs, attention-based masking, stochastic block dropping, or perturbations to the self-attention energy landscape. While these strategies refine the generation quality, they still lack reliable control over the granularity or difficulty of the negative samples, and target-layer selection is often fixed. We propose Exponential Moving Average Guidance (EMAG), a training-free mechanism that modifies attention at inference time in diffusion transformers, with a statistics-based, adaptive layer-selection rule. Unlike prior methods, EMAG produces harder, semantically faithful negatives (fine-grained degradations), surfacing difficult failure modes, enabling the denoiser to refine subtle artifacts, boosting the quality and human preference score (HPS) by +0.46 over CFG.

To address this limitation, we propose DRIM, a model that enables deep but reliable multi-turn reasoning when thinking with images in its multimodal CoT. Our pipeline comprises three stages: data construction, cold-start SFT and RL. Based on a high-resolution image dataset, we construct high-difficulty and verifiable visual question-answer pairs, where solving each task requires multi-turn tool calls to reach the correct answer. In the SFT stage, we collect tool trajectories as cold-start data, guiding a multi-turn reasoning pattern. In the RL stage, we introduce redundancy-penalized policy optimization, which incentivizes the model to develop a self-reflective reasoning pattern. The basic idea is to impose judgment on reasoning trajectories and penalize those that produce incorrect answers without sufficient multi-scale exploration.

In this work, we introduce AniX, leveraging the realism and structural grounding of static world generation while extending controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters capable of performing open-ended actions. Users can provide a 3DGS scene and a character, then direct the character through natural language to perform diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring the environment. AniX synthesizes temporally coherent video clips that preserve visual fidelity with the provided scene and character, formulated as a conditional autoregressive video generation problem. Built upon a pre-trained video generator, our training strategy significantly enhances motion dynamics while maintaining generalization across actions and characters. Our evaluation covers a broad range of aspects, including visual quality, character consistency, action controllability, and long-horizon coherence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AniX\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u5b9e\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u89d2\u8272\u57283D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u9759\u60013D\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u5141\u8bb8\u5355\u4e00\u5b9e\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9650\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u6267\u884c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "AniX\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b3DGS\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a7\u5236\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86AniX\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AniX\u6210\u529f\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u4e16\u754c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u5b9e\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u89d2\u8272\u57283D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u3002"}}

We introduce CodeDance, which explores executable code as a general solver for visual reasoning. Unlike fixed-schema calls (e.g., only predicting bounding-box coordinates), CodeDance defines, composes, and executes code to orchestrate multiple tools, compute intermediate results, and render visual artifacts (e.g., boxes, lines, plots) that support transparent, self-checkable reasoning. To guide this process, we introduce a reward for balanced and adaptive tool-call, which balances exploration with efficiency and mitigates tool overuse. Interestingly, beyond the expected capabilities taught by atomic supervision, we empirically observe novel emergent behaviors during RL training: CodeDance demonstrates novel tool invocations, unseen compositions, and cross-task transfer. These behaviors arise without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting a general and scalable mechanism of executable visual reasoning.

Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA-VLM) has emerged as a key solution, typically using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt models with minimal data. However, these PEFT methods are constrained by their reliance on fixed, handcrafted prompts, which are often insufficient to understand the semantics of classes. While some studies have proposed leveraging image-induced prompts to provide additional clues for classification, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead at inference. Therefore, we introduce Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge (ADK), a novel framework that efficiently enriches text representations without compromising efficiency. ADK first leverages a Large Language Model to generate a rich set of descriptive prompts for each class offline. These pre-computed features are then deployed in two ways: (1) as Compositional Knowledge, an averaged representation that provides rich semantics, especially beneficial when class names are ambiguous or unfamiliar to the VLM; and (2) as Instance-Specific Knowledge, where a lightweight, non-parametric attention mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant descriptions for a given image.

RadarGen adapts efficient image-latent diffusion to the radar domain by representing radar measurements in bird's-eye-view form that encodes spatial structure together with radar cross section (RCS) and Doppler attributes. A lightweight recovery step reconstructs point clouds from the generated maps. To better align generation with the visual scene, RadarGen incorporates BEV-aligned depth, semantic, and motion cues extracted from pretrained foundation models, which guide the stochastic generation process toward physically plausible radar patterns. Conditioning on images makes the approach broadly compatible, in principle, with existing visual datasets and simulation frameworks, offering a scalable direction for multimodal generative simulation. Evaluations on large-scale driving data show that RadarGen captures characteristic radar measurement distributions and reduces the gap to perception models trained on real data, marking a step toward unified generative simulation across sensing modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "RadarGen \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u8f66\u8f7d\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9e1f\u77b0\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u5408 RCS \u4e0e\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "RadarGen \u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u5230\u96f7\u8fbe\u57df\uff0c\u4ee5\u9e1f\u77b0\u56fe\u5f62\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u3001RCS \u548c\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6062\u590d\u6b65\u9aa4\u91cd\u5efa\u70b9\u4e91\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u6765\u81ea\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684 BEV \u5bf9\u9f50\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cRadarGen \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u96f7\u8fbe\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "RadarGen \u4e3a\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eff\u771f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Concept erasure techniques offer a promising solution by selectively removing undesired concepts from pre-trained models without requiring full retraining. However, these methods are often evaluated on a limited set of concepts, relying on overly simplistic and direct prompts. To test the boundaries of concept erasure techniques, and assess whether they truly remove targeted concepts from model representations, we introduce EMMA, a benchmark that evaluates five key dimensions of concept erasure over 12 metrics. EMMA goes beyond standard metrics like image quality and time efficiency, testing robustness under challenging conditions, including indirect descriptions, visually similar non-target concepts, and potential gender and ethnicity bias, providing a socially aware analysis of method behavior. Using EMMA, we analyze five concept erasure methods across five domains (objects, celebrities, art styles, NSFW, and copyright). Our results show that existing methods struggle with implicit prompts (i.e., generating the erased concept when it is indirectly referenced) and visually similar non-target concepts (i.e., failing to generate non-targeted concepts resembling the erased one), while some amplify gender and ethnicity bias compared to the original model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EMMA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u6db5\u76d612\u9879\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u7248\u6743\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u6280\u672f\u8bd5\u56fe\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u79fb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u64e6\u9664\u6548\u679c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86EMMA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ece\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5bf9\u95f4\u63a5\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6027\u522b\u4e0e\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\uff09\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc712\u9879\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u4e94\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u540d\u4eba\u3001\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u3001NSFW\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u7248\u6743\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u4ecd\u4f1a\u751f\u6210\u88ab\u64e6\u9664\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u88ab\u64e6\u9664\u6982\u5ff5\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u90e8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u751a\u81f3\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u5730\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u6027\u522b\u548c\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u6280\u672f\u5c1a\u672a\u771f\u6b63\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u4e2d\u5f7b\u5e95\u79fb\u9664\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u3002EMMA\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Thus, an adversary could aim to modify an image by adding unseen elements, which will confuse the AI in its recognition of an entity. This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision. Furthermore, they highlight that adversarial robustness does not necessarily correlate directly with standard benchmark performance and may be influenced by underlying architectural and training factors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86LLaVA-1.5-13B\u548cLlama 3.2 Vision-8B\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u7684PGD\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1Llama 3.2 Vision\u57fa\u51c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u6270\u52a8\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6108\u53d1\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u4eba\u773c\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u8bef\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728VQA v2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9LLaVA-1.5-13B\u548cLlama 3.2 Vision-8B\u65bd\u52a0\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u6027PGD\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6VQA\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "Llama 3.2 Vision\u5728\u8f83\u9ad8\u6270\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4LLaVA\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u4ee3\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u65e0\u5fc5\u7136\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Bhattarai", "Helge Rhodin"], "title": "Re-Depth Anything: Test-Time Depth Refinement via Self-Supervised Re-lighting", "comment": null, "summary": "Monocular depth estimation remains challenging as recent foundation models, such as Depth Anything V2 (DA-V2), struggle with real-world images that are far from the training distribution. We introduce Re-Depth Anything, a test-time self-supervision framework that bridges this domain gap by fusing DA-V2 with the powerful priors of large-scale 2D diffusion models. Our method performs label-free refinement directly on the input image by re-lighting predicted depth maps and augmenting the input. This re-synthesis method replaces classical photometric reconstruction by leveraging shape from shading (SfS) cues in a new, generative context with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To prevent optimization collapse, our framework employs a targeted optimization strategy: rather than optimizing depth directly or fine-tuning the full model, we freeze the encoder and only update intermediate embeddings while also fine-tuning the decoder. Across diverse benchmarks, Re-Depth Anything yields substantial gains in depth accuracy and realism over the DA-V2, showcasing new avenues for self-supervision by augmenting geometric reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRe-Depth Anything\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408Depth Anything V2\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a212D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u57df\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u671f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Depth Anything V2\uff09\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06DA-V2\u4e0e\u5927\u578b2D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u5e76\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5229\u7528Score Distillation Sampling\uff08SDS\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5f62\u72b6\u81ea\u9634\u5f71\uff08SfS\uff09\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5149\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u4e3a\u907f\u514d\u4f18\u5316\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4ec5\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4fdd\u6301\u51bb\u7ed3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cRe-Depth Anything\u76f8\u6bd4DA-V2\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "Re-Depth Anything\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Event cameras address this limitation by capturing per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution. Prior research on event-based video frame prediction has leveraged motion information from event data, often by predicting event-based optical flow and reconstructing frames via pixel warping. However, such approaches introduce holes and blurring when pixel displacement is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we propose DESSERT, a diffusion-based event-driven single-frame synthesis framework via residual training. Leveraging a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, our method is trained on inter-frame residuals to ensure temporal consistency. The training pipeline consists of two stages: (1) an Event-to-Residual Alignment Variational Autoencoder (ER-VAE) that aligns the event frame between anchor and target frames with the corresponding residual, and (2) a diffusion model that denoises the residual latent conditioned on event data. Furthermore, we introduce Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT) augmentation, which improves robustness by training on frame segments of varying temporal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing event-based reconstruction, image-based video frame prediction, event-based video frame prediction, and one-sided event-based video frame interpolation methods, producing sharper and more temporally consistent frame synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDESSERT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u5355\u5e27\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u65f6\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u7a7a\u6d1e\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5e27\u5408\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Stable Diffusion\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a(1) \u4e8b\u4ef6\u5230\u6b8b\u5dee\u5bf9\u9f50\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08ER-VAE\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e27\u4e0e\u5e27\u95f4\u6b8b\u5dee\uff1b(2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u566a\u6b8b\u5dee\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u957f\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\uff08DLT\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e27\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "DESSERT\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0e\u7a7a\u6d1e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

However, traditional explicit warping approaches often struggle with accurate motion transfer or recovering missing regions, while recent attention-based warping methods, though effective, frequently suffer from high complexity and weak geometric grounding. To address these issues, we propose SynergyWarpNet, an attention-guided cooperative warping framework designed for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Given a source portrait, a driving image, and a set of reference images, our model progressively refines the animation in three stages. First, an explicit warping module performs coarse spatial alignment between the source and driving image using 3D dense optical flow.

A critical limitation of current detectors is their failure to generalize to images from unseen generative models, as they often overfit to source-specific semantic cues rather than learning universal generative artifacts. To overcome this, we introduce a simple yet remarkably effective pixel-level mapping pre-processing step to disrupt the pixel value distribution of images and break the fragile, non-essential semantic patterns that detectors commonly exploit as shortcuts. This forces the detector to focus on more fundamental and generalizable high-frequency traces inherent to the image generation process. Through comprehensive experiments on GAN and diffusion-based generators, we show that our approach significantly boosts the cross-generator performance of state-of-the-art detectors. Extensive analysis further verifies our hypothesis that the disruption of semantic cues is the key to generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6620\u5c04\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7834\u574f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5173\u6ce8\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u666e\u904d\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u5176\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u6e90\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6620\u5c04\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u6270\u4e71\u56fe\u50cf\u50cf\u7d20\u503c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5e38\u5229\u7528\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u4e14\u975e\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u66f4\u6839\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u75d5\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728GAN\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u7834\u574f\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5e72\u6270\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose the Affective Image Filter (AIF) task, which aims to reflect visually-abstract emotions from text into visually-concrete images, thereby creating emotionally compelling results. We first introduce the AIF dataset and the formulation of the AIF models. Then, we present AIF-B as an initial attempt based on a multi-modal transformer architecture. After that, we propose AIF-D as an extension of AIF-B towards deeper emotional reflection, effectively leveraging generative priors from pre-trained large-scale diffusion models. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that AIF models achieve superior performance for both content consistency and emotional fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive user study experiments demonstrate that AIF models are significantly more effective at evoking specific emotions.

Existing resources are often limited in geographic scope and annotation detail, hindering the development of robust, generalized computer vision methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIFloodSense, a comprehensive, publicly available aerial imagery dataset comprising 470 high-resolution images from 230 distinct flood events across 64 countries and six continents. Unlike prior benchmarks, AIFloodSense ensures global diversity and temporal relevance (2022-2024), supporting three complementary tasks: (i) Image Classification with novel sub-tasks for environment type, camera angle, and continent recognition; (ii) Semantic Segmentation providing precise pixel-level masks for flood, sky, and buildings; and (iii) Visual Question Answering (VQA) to enable natural language reasoning for disaster assessment. We establish baseline benchmarks for all tasks using state-of-the-art architectures, demonstrating the dataset's complexity and its value in advancing domain-generalized AI tools for climate resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AIFloodSense\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d664\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u3001\u516d\u5927\u6d32230\u6b21\u6d2a\u6c34\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4e09\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u9762\u5411\u6c14\u5019\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u6cdb\u5316AI\u5de5\u5177\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d2a\u6c34\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u5730\u7406\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u7ec6\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5177\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03AIFloodSense\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b470\u5f20\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8986\u76d62022\u20132024\u5e74\u5168\u7403\u591a\u5730\u6d2a\u6c34\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4e09\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u5404\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u5f00\u53d1\u6cdb\u5316\u578b\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "AIFloodSense\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6d2a\u6c34\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u707e\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u6c14\u5019\u97e7\u6027AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

It leverages explicit 3D scene decomposition to represent driving videos as a scene graph, containing static background and dynamic objects. To enable fine-grained editing and realism, it incorporates an agentic pipeline in which an Orchestrator transforms user instructions into execution graphs that coordinate specialized agents and tools. Specifically, an Object Grounding Agent establishes correspondence between free-form text descriptions and target object nodes in the scene graph; a Behavior Editing Agent generates multi-object trajectories from language instructions; and a Behavior Reviewer Agent iteratively reviews and refines the generated trajectories. The edited scene graph is rendered and then refined using a video diffusion tool to address artifacts introduced by object insertion and significant view changes. LangDriveCTRL supports both object node editing (removal, insertion and replacement) and multi-object behavior editing from a single natural-language instruction.

Yet, current deep learning methods rely on centralized data collection, which raises privacy concerns and limits generalization across diverse institutions. In this paper, we propose TwinSegNet, which is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that integrates a hybrid ViT-UNet model with personalized digital twins for accurate and real-time brain tumor segmentation. Our architecture combines convolutional encoders with Vision Transformer bottlenecks to capture local and global context. Each institution fine-tunes the global model of private data to form its digital twin. Evaluated on nine heterogeneous MRI datasets, including BraTS 2019-2021 and custom tumor collections, TwinSegNet achieves high Dice scores (up to 0.90%) and sensitivity/specificity exceeding 90%, demonstrating robustness across non-independent and identically distributed (IID) client distributions. Comparative results against centralized models such as TumorVisNet highlight TwinSegNet's effectiveness in preserving privacy without sacrificing performance.

In this paper, we present an illuminant personalization method named LumiCtrl that learns an illuminant prompt given a single image of an object. LumiCtrl consists of three basic components: given an image of the object, our method applies (a) physics-based illuminant augmentation along the Planckian locus to create fine-tuning variants under standard illuminants; (b) edge-guided prompt disentanglement using a frozen ControlNet to ensure prompts focus on illumination rather than structure; and (c) a masked reconstruction loss that focuses learning on the foreground object while allowing the background to adapt contextually, enabling what we call contextual light adaptation. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare LumiCtrl against other T2I customization methods. The results show that our method achieves significantly better illuminant fidelity, aesthetic quality, and scene coherence compared to existing personalization baselines. A human preference study further confirms strong user preference for LumiCtrl outputs.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve impressive scores on existing benchmarks, a fundamental question remains: can MLLMs truly ground language in vision with human-like sophistication, or are they merely pattern-matching on simplified datasets? Current benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexity where humans effortlessly navigate ambiguous references and recognize when grounding is impossible. To rigorously assess MLLMs' true capabilities, we introduce GroundingME, a benchmark that systematically challenges models across four critical dimensions: (1) Discriminative, distinguishing highly similar objects, (2) Spatial, understanding complex relational descriptions, (3) Limited, handling occlusions or tiny objects, and (4) Rejection, recognizing ungroundable queries. Through careful curation combining automated generation with human verification, we create 1,005 challenging examples mirroring real-world complexity. Evaluating 25 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a profound capability gap: the best model achieves only 45.1% accuracy, while most score 0% on rejection tasks, reflexively hallucinating objects rather than acknowledging their absence, raising critical safety concerns for deployment. We explore two strategies for improvements: (1) test-time scaling selects optimal response by thinking trajectory to improve complex grounding by up to 2.9%, and (2) data-mixture training teaches models to recognize ungroundable queries, boosting rejection accuracy from 0% to 27.9%. GroundingME thus serves as both a diagnostic tool revealing current limitations in MLLMs and a roadmap toward human-level visual grounding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GroundingME\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321/\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u4ee5\u53ca\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u67e5\u8be2\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u5728\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u62d2\u7edd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u57fa\u51c6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u6307\u4ee3\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\u6765\u68c0\u9a8cMLLMs\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u63a5\u5730\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b1,005\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6837\u672c\u7684GroundingME\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u5224\u522b\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6027\u3001\u53d7\u9650\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u62d2\u6027\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f3025\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfMLLMs\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5728GroundingME\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a45.1%\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62d2\u7edd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u503e\u5411\uff1b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u53472.9%\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c06\u62d2\u7edd\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece0%\u63d0\u5347\u81f327.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u8fdc\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7f3a\u9677\uff1bGroundingME\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

The performance of pathology AI systems has been almost exclusively evaluated on European and US cohorts from large centers. For global AI adoption in pathology, validation studies on currently under-represented populations - where the potential gains from AI support may also be greatest - are needed. We present the first study with an external validation cohort from the Middle East, focusing on AI-based diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer.\n  Methods: We collected and digitised 339 prostate biopsy specimens from the Kurdistan region, Iraq, representing a consecutive series of 185 patients spanning the period 2013-2024. We evaluated a task-specific end-to-end AI model and two foundation models in terms of their concordance with pathologists and consistency across samples digitised on three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, and Grundium).\n  Findings: Grading concordance between AI and pathologists was similar to pathologist-pathologist concordance with Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799 (p=0.9824). Cross-scanner concordance was high (quadratically weighted kappa > 0.90) for all AI models and scanner pairs, including low-cost compact scanner.\n  Interpretation: AI models demonstrated pathologist-level performance in prostate histopathology assessment. Compact scanners can provide a route for validation studies in non-digitalised settings and enable cost-effective adoption of AI in laboratories with limited sample volumes. This first openly available digital pathology dataset from the Middle East supports further research into globally equitable AI pathology.\n  Funding: SciLifeLab and Wallenberg Data Driven Life Science Program, Instrumentarium Science Foundation, Karolinska Institutet Research Foundation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u4e2d\u4e1c\uff08\u4f0a\u62c9\u514b\u5e93\u5c14\u5fb7\u65af\u5766\u5730\u533a\uff09\u7684\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u6d3b\u68c0\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8AI\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eAI\u5728Gleason\u5206\u7ea7\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bbe\u5907\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u5730\u533a\u7684AI\u75c5\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u4e2d\u4e1c\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u75c5\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u6b27\u7f8e\u5927\u578b\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u4e3a\u63a8\u52a8AI\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4eba\u7fa4\u4e2d\u5f00\u5c55\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728AI\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u6700\u5927\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u5730\u533a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u4e862013\u20132024\u5e74\u95f4\u6765\u81ea\u4f0a\u62c9\u514b\u5e93\u5c14\u5fb7\u65af\u5766\u5730\u533a\u7684339\u4f8b\u524d\u5217\u817a\u6d3b\u68c0\u6837\u672c\uff08185\u540d\u60a3\u8005\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528AI\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0e\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u8bca\u65ad\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u8de8\u4e09\u79cd\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\uff08Hamamatsu\u3001Leica\u3001Grundium\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "AI\u4e0e\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684Gleason\u5206\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08Cohen\u52a0\u6743Kappa=0.801\uff09\u4e0e\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08Kappa=0.799\uff09\u76f8\u5f53\uff08p=0.9824\uff09\uff1b\u6240\u6709AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u95f4\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\uff09\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08Kappa>0.90\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u524d\u5217\u817a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u975e\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdbAI\u5728\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u4e2d\u4e1c\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u5168\u7403\u516c\u5e73\u7684AI\u75c5\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, domain shift often reduces the detector's ability to maintain strong object-focused representations, causing high-confidence activations over background clutter. This weak object focus results in unreliable pseudo-labels from the detection head. While prior works mainly refine these pseudo-labels, they overlook the underlying need to strengthen the feature space itself. We propose FALCON-SFOD (Foundation-Aligned Learning with Clutter suppression and Noise robustness), a framework designed to enhance object-focused adaptation under domain shift. It consists of two complementary components. SPAR (Spatial Prior-Aware Regularization) leverages the generalization strength of vision foundation models to regularize the detector's feature space. Using class-agnostic binary masks derived from OV-SAM, SPAR promotes structured and foreground-focused activations by guiding the network toward object regions.

However, most prior work extends these networks to predict additional Gaussian parameters -- orientation, scale, opacity, and appearance -- while relying almost exclusively on view-synthesis supervision. We show that a view-synthesis loss alone is insufficient to recover geometrically meaningful splats in this setting. We analyze and address the ambiguities of learning 3D Gaussian splats under self-supervision for pose-free generalizable splatting, and introduce G3Splat, which enforces geometric priors to obtain geometrically consistent 3D scene representations. Trained on RE10K, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in (i) geometrically consistent reconstruction, (ii) relative pose estimation, and (iii) novel-view synthesis. We further demonstrate strong zero-shot generalization on ScanNet, substantially outperforming prior work in both geometry recovery and relative pose estimation.

However, this field remains underexplored due to the scarcity of reproducible benchmarks and the limitations of existing image composition methods in achieving high-fidelity furniture synthesis while preserving background integrity. To overcome these challenges, we first present RoomBench++, a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark dataset tailored for this task. It consists of 112,851 training pairs and 1,832 testing pairs drawn from both real-world indoor videos and realistic home design renderings, thereby supporting robust training and evaluation under practical conditions. Then, we propose RoomEditor++, a versatile diffusion-based architecture featuring a parameter-sharing dual diffusion backbone, which is compatible with both U-Net and DiT architectures. This design unifies the feature extraction and inpainting processes for reference and background images. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the parameter-sharing mechanism enforces aligned feature representations, facilitating precise geometric transformations, texture preservation, and seamless integration. Extensive experiments validate that RoomEditor++ is superior over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments, and human preference studies, while highlighting its strong generalization to unseen indoor scenes and general scenes without task-specific fine-tuning.

While mainstream video SCI using random binary modulation has demonstrated success, it inevitably results in temporal aliasing during compression. One-hot modulation, activating only one sub-frame per pixel, provides a promising solution for achieving perfect temporal decoupling, thereby alleviating issues associated with aliasing. However, no algorithms currently exist to fully exploit this potential. To bridge this gap, we propose an algorithm specifically designed for one-hot masks. First, leveraging the decoupling properties of one-hot modulation, we transform the reconstruction task into a generative video inpainting problem and introduce a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the forward process that aligns with the hardware compression process. Next, we identify limitations of the pure diffusion method for video SCI and propose a novel framework that combines one-step regression initialization with one-step diffusion refinement. Furthermore, to mitigate the spatial degradation caused by one-hot modulation, we implement a dual optical path at the hardware level, utilizing complementary information from another path to enhance the inpainted video. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating diffusion into video SCI reconstruction.

To address this question, we conducted a large-scale systematic study of 241 biomedical image analysis challenges comprising 458 tasks across 19 imaging modalities. Our findings show substantial biases in dataset composition, including geographic location, modality-, and problem type-related biases, indicating that current benchmarks do not adequately reflect real-world clinical diversity.

Traditional approaches often rely on extensive labeled data and incur high computational costs. Recent tuning-free methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging their rich world knowledge. However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments show that HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, validating head-level probing in MLLMs as a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faHeadHunt-VAD\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u6316\u6398\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u654f\u611f\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3001\u6b63\u5e38\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u8c03\u4f18\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3001\u6b63\u5e38\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u5f02\u5e38\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHeadHunt-VAD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u9c81\u68d2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8bc6\u522b\u201d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684MLLM\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u4e13\u5bb6\u5934\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u8f93\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cHeadHunt-VAD\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728MLLM\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Multi-view 3D object detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving perception, where achieving a balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency remains crucial. Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs). Furthermore, a dynamic confidence gating mechanism adaptively evaluates the reliability of temporal stereo cues through learning statistical patterns derived from the inter-frame matching matrix together with appearance consistency, ensuring robust detection under object appearance and occlusion. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that StereoMV2D achieves superior detection performance without incurring significant computational overhead.

Existing methods operate under a closed-world assumption, treating the task as a classification problem over a small, predefined verb set, which struggles to generalize to the long-tail of unseen or ambiguous interactions in the wild. While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess the rich world knowledge required for open-vocabulary understanding, they remain decoupled from existing HOI detectors since fine-tuning them is computationally prohibitive. To address these constraints, we propose \\GRASP-HO}, a novel Generative Reasoning And Steerable Perception framework that reformulates HOI detection from the closed-set classification task to the open-vocabulary generation problem. To bridge the vision and cognitive, we first extract hybrid interaction representations, then design a lightweight learnable cognitive steering conduit (CSC) module to inject the fine-grained visual evidence into a frozen MLLM for effective reasoning. To address the supervision mismatch between classification-based HOI datasets and open-vocabulary generative models, we introduce a hybrid guidance strategy that coupling the language modeling loss and auxiliary classification loss, enabling discriminative grounding without sacrificing generative flexibility. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art closed-set performance and strong zero-shot generalization, achieving a unified paradigm that seamlessly bridges discriminative perception and generative reasoning for open-world HOI detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGRASP-HO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08HOI\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ece\u5c01\u95ed\u96c6\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5224\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u5728\u95ed\u96c6\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709HOI\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5c01\u95ed\u4e16\u754c\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u91ce\u5916\u672a\u89c1\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u800c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u5907\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5374\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGRASP-HO\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u4e92\u8868\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5f15\u5bfc\u901a\u9053\uff08CSC\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684MLLM\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u95ed\u96c6\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754cHOI\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5224\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u878d\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "GRASP-HO\u6210\u529f\u5c06HOI\u68c0\u6d4b\u62d3\u5c55\u81f3\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3MLLM\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bc6\u522b\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, shaping such in-context learning for instruction-based video editing is not trivial. Without specifying editing regions, the results can suffer from the problem of inaccurate editing regions and the token interference between editing and non-editing areas during denoising. To address these, we present ReCo, a new instructional video editing paradigm that novelly delves into constraint modeling between editing and non-editing regions during in-context generation. Technically, ReCo width-wise concatenates source and target video for joint denoising. To calibrate video diffusion learning, ReCo capitalizes on two regularization terms, i.e., latent and attention regularization, conducting on one-step backward denoised latents and attention maps, respectively. The former increases the latent discrepancy of the editing region between source and target videos while reducing that of non-editing areas, emphasizing the modification on editing area and alleviating outside unexpected content generation. The latter suppresses the attention of tokens in the editing region to the tokens in counterpart of the source video, thereby mitigating their interference during novel object generation in target video. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale, high-quality video editing dataset, i.e., ReCo-Data, comprising 500K instruction-video pairs to benefit model training. Extensive experiments conducted on four major instruction-based video editing tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aReCo\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u975e\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u8f91\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b50\u4e07\u6761\u6307\u4ee4-\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6ReCo-Data\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u975e\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4token\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "ReCo\u5c06\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u9891\u6a2a\u5411\u62fc\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\uff1a\u6f5c\u5728\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u5728\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u9891\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u6291\u5236\u975e\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u524a\u5f31\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57dftoken\u5bf9\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f4d\u7f6etoken\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u6570\u636e\u96c6ReCo-Data\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u9879\u4e3b\u6d41\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ReCo\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u975e\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u914d\u5957\u6570\u636e\u96c6ReCo-Data\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

These advances now enable granular and precise quantification of facial expression, head movement, body action, and other behavioral modalities and are increasingly used in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research. However, mainstream adoption remains slow. Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap. It gives behavioral researchers access to robust, high-level behavioral metrics without requiring engineering expertise, and it provides computer scientists a practical mechanism for disseminating methods to domains where their impact is most needed. We expect that Bitbox will accelerate integration of computational behavioral measurement into behavioral, clinical, and mental health research.

It leverages a transformer-based reconstruction model with structured head query tokens as canonical anchor to aggregate flexible input-number-agnostic, camera-pose-free and expression-free inputs into a robust canonical 3D representation. For detailed dynamic deformation, we introduce a lightweight UNet decoder conditioned on UV-space position maps, which can produce detailed expression-dependent deformations in real time.

However, existing datasets are largely limited to either simulated environments or human-driven vehicle data, lacking authentic ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) vehicle behavior under risk conditions. To address this gap, this paper introduces SAVeD, a large-scale video dataset curated from publicly available social media content, explicitly focused on ADAS vehicle-related crashes, near-miss incidents, and disengagements. SAVeD features 2,119 first-person videos, capturing ADAS vehicle operations in diverse locations, lighting conditions, and weather scenarios. The dataset includes video frame-level annotations for collisions, evasive maneuvers, and disengagements, enabling analysis of both perception and decision-making failures. We demonstrate SAVeD's utility through multiple analyses and contributions: (1) We propose a novel framework integrating semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation to compute real-time Time-to-Collision (TTC) for dynamic objects. (2) We utilize the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to model and quantify the extreme risk in crash and near-miss events across different roadway types.

Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a solution by treating each WSI as a bag of patch-level instances, but effectively modeling ultra-long sequences with rich spatial context remains difficult. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative for long sequence learning, scaling linearly to thousands of tokens. However, despite its efficiency, it still suffers from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay, constraining its effectiveness to WSI analysis. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMIL+, a new MIL framework that explicitly integrates spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting. Specifically, MambaMIL+ introduces 1) overlapping scanning, which restructures the patch sequence to embed spatial continuity and instance correlations; 2) a selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) that encodes positional information while mitigating the biases of fixed scanning orders; and 3) a contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism, which leverages supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge the contextual memory for stable long-range modeling. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH), highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for large-scale computational pathology", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMambaMIL+\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u91cd\u53e0\u626b\u63cf\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6761\u5e26\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08S2PE\uff09\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff08CTS\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u5f0f\u6574\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\uff08WSI\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\uff08WSI\uff09\u5177\u6709\u5343\u5146\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1Mamba\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728WSI\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u4ecd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8870\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "MambaMIL+\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u91cd\u53e0\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u91cd\u6784\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u5e8f\u5217\u4ee5\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6761\u5e26\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08S2PE\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u8f7b\u56fa\u5b9a\u626b\u63cf\u987a\u5e8f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff1b3\uff09\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\uff08CTS\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u77e5\u8bc6\u52a8\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6db5\u76d6\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u768420\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMambaMIL+\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff08ResNet-50\u3001PLIP\u548cCONCH\uff09\u4e0b\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MambaMIL+\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A key challenge is generalization, as detectors trained on a narrow class of generators often fail when confronted with unseen models. In this work, we address the pressing need for generalizable detection by leveraging large vision-language models, specifically CLIP, to identify synthetic content across diverse generative techniques. First, we introduce Diff-Gen, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 100k diffusion-generated fakes that capture broad spectral artifacts unlike traditional GAN datasets. Models trained on Diff-Gen demonstrate stronger cross-domain generalization, particularly on previously unseen image generators. Second, we propose AdaptPrompt, a parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that jointly learns task-specific textual prompts and visual adapters while keeping the CLIP backbone frozen. We further show via layer ablation that pruning the final transformer block of the vision encoder enhances the retention of high-frequency generative artifacts, significantly boosting detection accuracy. Our evaluation spans 25 challenging test sets, covering synthetic content generated by GANs, diffusion models, and commercial tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art in both standard and cross-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the framework's versatility through few-shot generalization (using as few as 320 images) and source attribution, enabling the precise identification of generator architectures in closed-set settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6Diff-Gen\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684AdaptPrompt\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u53c2\u6570\u7684CLIP\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Diff-Gen\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cAdaptPrompt\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6700\u540e\u7684Transformer\u5757\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6db5\u76d6GAN\u3001\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u5de5\u5177\u751f\u6210\u768425\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c11\u81f3320\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u6eaf\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u65e5\u76ca\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5a92\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, cloud contamination frequently obscures LST observations, limiting their usability for continuous SUHI analysis. Most existing LST reconstruction methods rely on multitemporal information or multisensor data fusion, requiring auxiliary observations that may be unavailable or unreliable under persistent cloud cover. Purely spatial gap-filling approaches offer an alternative, but traditional statistical methods degrade under large or spatially contiguous gaps, while many deep learning based spatial models deteriorate rapidly with increasing missingness.\n  Recent advances in denoising diffusion based image inpainting models have demonstrated improved robustness under high missingness, motivating their adoption for spatial LST reconstruction. In this work, we introduce UrbanDIFF, a purely spatial denoising diffusion model for reconstructing cloud contaminated urban LST imagery. The model is conditioned on static urban structure information, including built-up surface data and a digital elevation model, and enforces strict consistency with revealed cloud free pixels through a supervised pixel guided refinement step during inference.\n  UrbanDIFF is trained and evaluated using NASA MODIS Terra LST data from seven major United States metropolitan areas spanning 2002 to 2025. Experiments using synthetic cloud masks with 20 to 85 percent coverage show that UrbanDIFF consistently outperforms an interpolation baseline, particularly under dense cloud occlusion, achieving SSIM of 0.89, RMSE of 1.2 K, and R2 of 0.84 at 85 percent cloud coverage, while exhibiting slower performance degradation as cloud density increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUrbanDIFF\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u53d7\u4e91\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\uff08LST\uff09\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u536b\u661f\u9065\u611fLST\u4ea7\u54c1\u5e38\u56e0\u4e91\u6c61\u67d3\u800c\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u6216\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u4e0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff1b\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u586b\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u6216\u8fde\u7eed\u7f3a\u5931\u533a\u57df\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u591a\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u968f\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u589e\u52a0\u6027\u80fd\u8fc5\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUrbanDIFF\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u5efa\u6210\u533a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u50cf\u7d20\u5f15\u5bfc\u7cbe\u70bc\u6b65\u9aa4\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u65e0\u4e91\u50cf\u7d20\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u57282002\u20132025\u5e74\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e03\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u533a\u7684MODIS Terra LST\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cUrbanDIFF\u572820%\u201385%\u5408\u6210\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u63d2\u503c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u572885%\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230SSIM 0.89\u3001RMSE 1.2 K\u3001R\u00b2 0.84\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u4e91\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u66f4\u7f13\u6162\u3002", "conclusion": "UrbanDIFF\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4e91\u6c61\u67d3\u4e0b\u7684\u57ce\u5e02LST\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SUHI\u76d1\u6d4b\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We address this gap by introducing Chorus, a multi-teacher pretraining framework that learns a holistic feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene encoder by distilling complementary signals from 2D foundation models. Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure.\n  We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs. Interestingly, this encoder shows strong transfer and outperforms the point clouds baseline while using 39.9 times fewer training scenes.

However, the fundamental design choice of diffusing data all the way to white noise and then reconstructing it leads to an extremely difficult and computationally intractable prediction task. To overcome this limitation, we propose InSPECT (Invariant Spectral Feature-Preserving Diffusion Model), a novel diffusion model that keeps invariant spectral features during both the forward and backward processes. At the end of the forward process, the Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to a specified random noise, enabling features preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness. By preserving invariant features, InSPECT demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and a smoother diffusion process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN demonstrate that InSPECT achieves on average a 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations under specified parameter settings, which demonstrates the significant advantages of preserving invariant features: achieving superior generation quality and diversity, while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence rate.

While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents. We refer readers to the supplemental video, where the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of generated interactions are best appreciated.

However, current digital twins remain largely static and are limited to navigation and view synthesis without embodied interactivity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Dexterous World Model (DWM), a scene-action-conditioned video diffusion framework that models how dexterous human actions induce dynamic changes in static 3D scenes.\n  Given a static 3D scene rendering and an egocentric hand motion sequence, DWM generates temporally coherent videos depicting plausible human-scene interactions. Our approach conditions video generation on (1) static scene renderings following a specified camera trajectory to ensure spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings that encode both geometry and motion cues to model action-conditioned dynamics directly. To train DWM, we construct a hybrid interaction video dataset. Synthetic egocentric interactions provide fully aligned supervision for joint locomotion and manipulation learning, while fixed-camera real-world videos contribute diverse and realistic object dynamics.\n  Experiments demonstrate that DWM enables realistic and physically plausible interactions, such as grasping, opening, and moving objects, while maintaining camera and scene consistency. This framework represents a first step toward video diffusion-based interactive digital twins and enables embodied simulation from egocentric actions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Dexterous World Model\uff08DWM\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u9759\u60013D\u573a\u666f\u548c\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u591a\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5177\u8eab\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u3002\u4e3a\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u7075\u5de7\u4eba\u624b\u52a8\u4f5c\u5982\u4f55\u5f15\u53d1\u9759\u60013D\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "DWM\u91c7\u7528\u573a\u666f-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6307\u5b9a\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0b\u7684\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u7f51\u683c\u6e32\u67d3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u7684\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u76f8\u673a\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDWM\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6548\u679c\uff08\u5982\u6293\u53d6\u3001\u6253\u5f00\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DWM\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u8eab\u4eff\u771f\u3002"}}

To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9762\u5411\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u6548\u9002\u914d\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49-\u50cf\u7d20\u91cd\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7d27\u51d1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u6d41\u5f62\u5916\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u672c\u8eab\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cbe\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49-\u50cf\u7d20\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u538b\u7f29\u81f3\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0896\u901a\u9053\uff0c16\u500d\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9762\u5411\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u3002"}}
