Using a similar construction, we extend this bound for curves in 2D under the continuous or discrete Fr\u00e9chet distance and increase the approximation factor to $1+\\sqrt{2}-\\varepsilon$ (resp. $3-\\varepsilon$) if the curves lie in the Euclidean space (resp. in the $L_\\infty$-space). This strengthens the lower bound by Buchin, Ophelders, and Speckmann to the case where $m=n^\u03b1$ for $\u03b1\\in(0,1)$ and increases the approximation factor of $1.001$ by Bringmann. For the discrete Fr\u00e9chet distance in 1D, we provide an approximation algorithm with optimal approximation factor and almost optimal running time. Further, for curves in any dimension embedded in any $L_p$ space, we present a $(3+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the continuous and discrete Fr\u00e9chet distance using $\\mathcal{O}((n+m^2)\\log n)$ time, which almost matches the approximation factor of the lower bound for the $L_\\infty$ metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\uff0cFr\u00e9chet\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "Fr\u00e9chet\u8ddd\u79bb\u662f\u8861\u91cf\u4e24\u6761\u66f2\u7ebf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u4ea4\u5411\u91cf\u5047\u8bbe\uff08OVH\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5f52\u7ea6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e861D\u79bb\u6563Fr\u00e9chet\u8ddd\u79bb\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff1b\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6784\u9020\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u6269\u5c55\u81f32D\u8fde\u7eed/\u79bb\u6563\u60c5\u5f62\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u57281D\u4e2d\uff0c\u79bb\u6563Fr\u00e9chet\u8ddd\u79bb\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728$\\mathcal{O}((nm)^{1-\u03b4})$\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4ee5\u56e0\u5b50$2-\\varepsilon$\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff1b\u57282D\u6b27\u6c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c$L_\\infty$\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0b\u754c\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u81f3$1+\\sqrt{2}-\\varepsilon$\u548c$3-\\varepsilon$\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e861D\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u8fd1\u4f3c\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4efb\u610f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b$(3+\\varepsilon)$-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86Fr\u00e9chet\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u6781\u9650\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f2\u7ebf\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Progress in AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis is constrained by the absence of benchmarks that simultaneously provide realistic patient simulation, clinician-verified diagnostic labels, and support for dynamic multi-turn consultation. We present LingxiDiagBench, a large-scale multi-agent benchmark that evaluates LLMs on both static diagnostic inference and dynamic multi-turn psychiatric consultation in Chinese. At its core is LingxiDiag-16K, a dataset of 16,000 EMR-aligned synthetic consultation dialogues designed to reproduce real clinical demographic and diagnostic distributions across 12 ICD-10 psychiatric categories. Through extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, we establish key findings: (1) although LLMs achieve high accuracy on binary depression--anxiety classification (up to 92.3%), performance deteriorates substantially for depression--anxiety comorbidity recognition (43.0%) and 12-way differential diagnosis (28.5%); (2) dynamic consultation often underperforms static evaluation, indicating that ineffective information-gathering strategies significantly impair downstream diagnostic reasoning; (3) consultation quality assessed by LLM-as-a-Judge shows only moderate correlation with diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that well-structured questioning alone does not ensure correct diagnostic decisions.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UI-Venus-1.5 establishes new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as ScreenSpot-Pro (69.6%), VenusBench-GD (75.0%), and AndroidWorld (77.6%), significantly outperforming previous strong baselines.

Typically, researchers study program synthesis via large language models (LLMs) which introduce issues such as knowing what is in or out of distribution, understanding fine-tuning effects, understanding the effects of tokenization, and higher demand on compute and storage to carry out experiments. We present a system called Cadmus which includes an integer virtual machine (VM), a dataset composed of true programs of diverse tasks, and an autoregressive transformer model that is trained for under \\$200 of compute cost. The system can be used to study program completion, out-of-distribution representations, inductive reasoning, and instruction following in a setting where researchers have effective and affordable fine-grained control of the training distribution and the ability to inspect and instrument models. Smaller models working on complex reasoning tasks enable instrumentation and investigations that may be prohibitively expensive on larger models. To demonstrate that these tasks are complex enough to be of interest, we show that these Cadmus models outperform GPT-5 (by achieving 100\\% accuracy while GPT-5 has 95\\% accuracy) even on a simple task of completing correct, integer arithmetic programs in our domain-specific language (DSL) while providing transparency into the dataset's relationship to the problem. We also show that GPT-5 brings unknown priors into its reasoning process when solving the same tasks, demonstrating a confounding factor that prevents the use of large-scale LLMs for some investigations where the training set relationship to the task needs to be fully understood.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCadmus\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6574\u6570\u865a\u62df\u673a\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u81ea\u56de\u5f52Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8865\u5168\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8868\u793a\u3001\u5f52\u7eb3\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u96be\u4ee5\u754c\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u5916\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u3001\u5206\u8bcd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u660e\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Cadmus\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u6570\u865a\u62df\u673a\uff08VM\uff09\u3001\u4e00\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e8e200\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5141\u8bb8\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u63d2\u6869\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "Cadmus\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b8c\u6210\u6574\u6570\u7b97\u672f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230100%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eGPT-5\u768495%\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793aGPT-5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u672a\u77e5\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002Cadmus\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Although research on multi-agent systems has diversified into numerous specialized directions, textbooks -- including those in English -- that provide a systematic treatment of the fundamental principles of multi-agent system control remain scarce. The material presented in this book has been developed and used in teaching since 2021, initially as a concise Vietnamese-language reference for the courses Networked Control Systems and Control of Multi-Agent Systems at Hanoi University of Science and Technology. The book focuses on a selection of fundamental topics of broad and continuing interest in the field. The complexity of several topics is asymptotic to that encountered in research-level studies, however, the analysis is presented in a step-by-step manner to facilitate access to commonly used methods and tools.\n  The material is divided into three main parts. Part I introduces multiagent systems and basic graph-theoretic concepts. Part II addresses the design and analysis of linear consensus algorithms. Part III covers selected applications and research directions, including formation control, network localization, distributed optimization, opinion dynamics, and matrix-weighted networks. Each chapter concludes with notes on notable researchers in this field, further reading, and exercises.\n  This book cannot be completed without the encouragement, support and suggestions from families, colleagues and friends.

We propose The Hypothesis Game, a symbolic formalism for hypothesis refinement in which LLM agents operate on a shared hypothesis state using a fixed grammar of reasoning moves. The framework is motivated by the observation that scientific progress often proceeds through small, localized revisions, grounded in domain context, rather than extensive rewrites. We instantiate a minimal game with LLM agents and evaluate it on pathway-level mechanistic refinement tasks. In the primary setting of corruption recovery, where hypotheses contain controlled errors, the game-based approach consistently removes more errors and achieves higher precision than strong prompting baselines, while preserving valid structure through incremental edits. In a secondary reconstruction setting from partial cues, it performs comparably to the strongest baseline, indicating that explicit move-based refinement remains competitive even when ground-truth recovery is difficult.

Existing video representation approaches overly rely on static appearance and scene context rather than motion dynamics, a bias inherited from their training data and objectives. Conversely, traditional motion-centric inputs like optical flow lack the semantic grounding needed to understand high-level motion. To demonstrate this inherent bias, we introduce the SimMotion benchmarks, combining controlled synthetic data with a new human-annotated real-world dataset. We show that existing models perform poorly on these benchmarks, often failing to disentangle motion from appearance. To address this gap, we propose SemanticMoments, a simple, training-free method that computes temporal statistics (specifically, higher-order moments) over features from pre-trained semantic models. Across our benchmarks, SemanticMoments consistently outperforms existing RGB, flow, and text-supervised methods. This demonstrates that temporal statistics in a semantic feature space provide a scalable and perceptually grounded foundation for motion-centric video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u5916\u89c2\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u8bed\u4e49\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SimMotion\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SemanticMoments\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u9636\u65f6\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u6d41\u7b49\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u53c8\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSemanticMoments\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u77e9\uff08\u5982\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u504f\u5ea6\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5177\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684SimMotion\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5305\u542b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cSemanticMoments\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8fd0\u52a8\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eRGB\u3001\u5149\u6d41\u53ca\u6587\u672c\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We propose Progress-Aware Belief Update (PABU), a belief-state framework that compactly represents an agent's state by explicitly modeling task progress and selectively retaining past actions and observations. At each step, the agent predicts its relative progress since the previous round and decides whether the newly encountered interaction should be stored, conditioning future decisions only on the retained subset. Across eight environments in the AgentGym benchmark, and using identical training trajectories, PABU achieves an 81.0% task completion rate, outperforming previous State of the art (SoTA) models with full-history belief by 23.9%. Additionally, PABU's progress-oriented action selection improves efficiency, reducing the average number of interaction steps to 9.5, corresponding to a 26.9% reduction.

Accepted for publication at the 2026 IEEE Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI)", "summary": "The growing volume of video-based news content has heightened the need for transparent and reliable methods to extract on-screen information. Yet the variability of graphical layouts, typographic conventions, and platform-specific design patterns renders manual indexing impractical. This work presents a comprehensive framework for automatically detecting and extracting personal names from broadcast and social-media-native news videos. It introduces a curated and balanced corpus of annotated frames capturing the diversity of contemporary news graphics and proposes an interpretable, modular extraction pipeline designed to operate under deterministic and auditable conditions.\n  The pipeline is evaluated against a contrasting class of generative multimodal methods, revealing a clear trade-off between deterministic auditability and stochastic inference. The underlying detector achieves 95.8% mAP@0.5, demonstrating operationally robust performance for graphical element localisation. While generative systems achieve marginally higher raw accuracy (F1: 84.18% vs 77.08%), they lack the transparent data lineage required for journalistic and analytical contexts.

Maintaining these resources requires expert curators to search relevant papers, reconcile evidence across documents, and produce ontology-grounded annotations - a workflow that existing benchmarks, focused on isolated subtasks like named entity recognition or relation extraction, do not capture. We present FlyBench to evaluate AI agents on end-to-end agentic ontology curation from scientific literature. Given only a gene symbol, agents must search and read from a corpus of 16,898 full-text papers to produce structured annotations: Gene Ontology terms describing function, expression patterns, and historical synonyms linking decades of nomenclature. The benchmark includes 7,397 expert-curated annotations across 100 genes drawn from FlyBase, the Drosophila (fruit fly) knowledge base. We evaluate four baseline agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent. We find that architectural choices significantly impact performance, with multi-agent designs outperforming simpler alternatives, yet scaling backbone models yields diminishing returns. All baselines leave substantial room for improvement. Our analysis surfaces several findings to guide future development; for example, agents primarily use retrieval to confirm parametric knowledge rather than discover new information.

Despite recent advancements in generating photorealistic outputs, current models often struggle with maintaining semantic fidelity and structural coherence when processing intricate textual inputs. We propose a novel approach that grounds text-to-image synthesis within the framework of scene graph structures, aiming to enhance the compositional abilities of existing models. Eventhough, prior approaches have attempted to address this by using pre-defined layout maps derived from prompts, such rigid constraints often limit compositional flexibility and diversity. In contrast, we introduce a zero-shot, scene graph-based conditioning mechanism that generates soft visual guidance during inference. At the core of our method is the Attribute-Size-Quantity-Location (ASQL) Conditioner, which produces visual conditions via a lightweight language model and guides diffusion-based generation through inference-time optimization.

We evaluated the feasibility of forecasting the anterior-posterior (AP) foot center-of-pressure (COP) and time-of-impact (TOI) prior to foot-strike on a level-ground to stair-ascent transition. Eight subjects wore an RGB-D camera on their right shank and instrumented insoles while performing the task of stepping onto the stairs. We trained a CNN-RNN to forecast the COP and TOI continuously within a 250ms window prior to foot-strike, termed the forecast horizon (FH). The COP mean-absolute-error (MAE) at 150, 100, and 50ms FH was 29.42mm, 26.82, and 23.72mm respectively. The TOI MAE was 21.14, 20.08, and 17.73ms for 150, 100, and 50ms respectively. While torso velocity had no effect on the error in either task, faster toe-swing speeds prior to foot-strike were found to improve the prediction accuracy in the COP case, however, was insignificant in the TOI case. Further, more anterior foot-strikes were found to reduce COP prediction accuracy but did not affect the TOI prediction accuracy. We also found that our lightweight model was capable at running at 60 FPS on either a consumer grade laptop or an edge computing device. This study demonstrates that forecasting COP and TOI from visual data was feasible using a lightweight model, which may have important implications for anticipatory control in assistive systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN-RNN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528RGB-D\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u5728\u8db3\u90e8\u89e6\u5730\u524d250\u6beb\u79d2\u5185\u9884\u6d4b\u8db3\u5e95\u524d\u540e\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u538b\u529b\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08COP\uff09\u548c\u89e6\u5730\u65f6\u95f4\uff08TOI\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u697c\u68af\u4e0a\u5347\u8fc7\u6e21\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b65\u6001\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u5206\u7c7b\u4ee5\u8f85\u52a9\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8db3\u90e8\u5982\u4f55\u63a5\u89e6\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u8db3\u5e95\u538b\u529b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u89e6\u5730\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u52a9\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u516b\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u5728\u53f3\u5c0f\u817f\u4f69\u6234RGB-D\u76f8\u673a\u5e76\u7a7f\u6234\u4eea\u5668\u5316\u978b\u57ab\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u4ece\u5e73\u5730\u5230\u697c\u68af\u4e0a\u5347\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aCNN-RNN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u89e6\u5730\u524d250\u6beb\u79d2\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u8fde\u7eed\u9884\u6d4bCOP\u548cTOI\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u957f\uff08150\u3001100\u300150\u6beb\u79d2\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "COP\u5728150\u3001100\u548c50\u6beb\u79d2\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u957f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a29.42mm\u300126.82mm\u548c23.72mm\uff1bTOI\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a21.14ms\u300120.08ms\u548c17.73ms\u3002\u8f83\u5feb\u7684\u811a\u8dbe\u6446\u52a8\u901f\u5ea6\u53ef\u63d0\u5347COP\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u9760\u524d\u7684\u843d\u811a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4eCOP\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u8eaf\u5e72\u901f\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u6216\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4ee560 FPS\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4bCOP\u548cTOI\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5728\u52a9\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

A central challenge is to localize uncertainty to its source, determining whether it arises from the image, the text, or misalignment between the two. We introduce VLM-UQBench, a benchmark for modality-specific and cross-modal data uncertainty in VLMs, It consists of 600 real-world samples drawn from the VizWiz dataset, curated into clean, image-, text-, and cross-modal uncertainty subsets, and a scalable perturbation pipeline with 8 visual, 5 textual, and 3 cross-modal perturbations. We further propose two simple metrics that quantify the sensitivity of UQ scores to these perturbations and their correlation with hallucinations, and use them to evaluate a range of UQ methods across four VLMs and three datasets. Empirically, we find that: (i) existing UQ methods exhibit strong modality-specific specialization and substantial dependence on the underlying VLM, (ii) modality-specific uncertainty frequently co-occurs with hallucinations while current UQ scores provide only weak and inconsistent risk signals, and (iii) although UQ methods can rival reasoning-based chain-of-thought baselines on overt, group-level ambiguity, they largely fail to detect the subtle, instance-level ambiguity introduced by our perturbation pipeline. These results highlight a significant gap between current UQ practices and the fine-grained, modality-aware uncertainty required for reliable VLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VLM-UQBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4e2d\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff08UQ\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u786e\u4fdd\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u9700\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5176\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6216\u4e24\u8005\u9519\u4f4d\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b600\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\u7684VLM-UQBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u5e72\u51c0\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b8\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u30015\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u548c3\u79cd\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6270\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8861\u91cfUQ\u5206\u6570\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2aVLM\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cdUQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "(1) \u73b0\u6709UQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e95\u5c42VLM\uff1b(2) \u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e38\u4f34\u968f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524dUQ\u5206\u6570\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fae\u5f31\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b(3) UQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u5728\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u660e\u663e\u6a21\u7cca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5ab2\u7f8e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5374\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6270\u52a8\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6a21\u7cca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dUQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760VLM\u90e8\u7f72\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This heuristic discards the evidential structure of reasoning traces and is brittle under the confabulation consensus, where agents share correlated biases and converge on the same incorrect rationale. We introduce AgentAuditor, which replaces voting with a path search over a Reasoning Tree that explicitly represents agreements and divergences among agent traces. AgentAuditor resolves conflicts by comparing reasoning branches at critical divergence points, turning global adjudication into efficient, localized verification. We further propose Anti-Consensus Preference Optimization (ACPO), which trains the adjudicator on majority-failure cases and rewards evidence-based minority selections over popular errors.

Nevertheless, recent approaches discard modulation-based text conditioning and rely exclusively on attention. In this paper, we address whether modulation-based text conditioning is necessary and whether it can provide any performance advantage. Our analysis shows that, in its conventional usage, the pooled embedding contributes little to overall performance, suggesting that attention alone is generally sufficient for faithfully propagating prompt information. However, we reveal that the pooled embedding can provide significant gains when used from a different perspective-serving as guidance and enabling controllable shifts toward more desirable properties. This approach is training-free, simple to implement, incurs negligible runtime overhead, and can be applied to various diffusion models, bringing improvements across diverse tasks, including text-to-image/video generation and image editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u6563Transformer\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u7528\u6cd5\u4e0b\u5176\u8d21\u732e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u82e5\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u6269\u6563Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c60\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4f20\u7edf\u8c03\u5236\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6c60\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8c03\u5236\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u8d21\u732e\u5fae\u5f31\uff0c\u4f46\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf/\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u53ca\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u672c\u8eab\u5df2\u8db3\u4ee5\u4f20\u9012\u63d0\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u6c60\u5316\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u82e5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u5219\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Medical imaging presents a unique challenge for existing dataset ownership verification methods designed for natural images, as static watermark patterns generated in fixed-scale images scale poorly dynamic and high-resolution scans with limited visual diversity and subtle anatomical structures, while preserving diagnostic quality. In this paper, we propose X-Mark, a sample-specific clean-label watermarking method for chest x-ray copyright protection. Specifically, X-Mark uses a conditional U-Net to generate unique perturbations within salient regions of each sample. We design a multi-component training objective to ensure watermark efficacy, robustness against dynamic scaling processes while preserving diagnostic quality and visual-distinguishability. We incorporate Laplacian regularization into our training objective to penalize high-frequency perturbations and achieve watermark scale-invariance. Ownership verification is performed in a black-box setting to detect characteristic behaviors in suspicious models. Extensive experiments on CheXpert verify the effectiveness of X-Mark, achieving WSR of 100% and reducing probability of false positives in Ind-M scenario by 12%, while demonstrating resistance to potential adaptive attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faX-Mark\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5b9a\u3001\u5e72\u51c0\u6807\u7b7e\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bca\u65ad\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7248\u6743\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u4f7f\u7528\u5f15\u53d1\u7248\u6743\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u9762\u5411\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u3002", "method": "X-Mark\u5229\u7528\u6761\u4ef6U-Net\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\u751f\u6210\u72ec\u7279\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6c34\u5370\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ca\u8bca\u65ad\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u6270\u52a8\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u7591\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u884c\u4e3a\u8fdb\u884c\u6240\u6709\u6743\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728CheXpert\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cX-Mark\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86100%\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08WSR\uff09\uff0c\u5728Ind-M\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c06\u8bef\u62a5\u6982\u7387\u964d\u4f4e12%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "X-Mark\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u7248\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2d\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Physics demands that a model maintain physical consistency with the laws governing the universe, a task that fundamentally requires multimodal perception to ground abstract logic in reality. At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference. Evaluated on HiPhO, a rigorous benchmark of 13 exams from 2024-2025, our flagship P1-VL-235B-A22B becomes the first open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) to secure 12 gold medals and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the open-source models.

Most patients do not acquire a wound which needs immediate hospitalization. However, due to factors such as delay in treatment, patient's non-compliance or existing co-morbid conditions, an injury can deteriorate and ultimately lead to patient hospitalization. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-modal method to predict the patient's risk of hospitalization. Our goal is to predict the risk confidently by collectively using the wound variables and wound images of the patient. Existing works in this domain have mainly focused on healing trajectories based on distinct wound types. We developed a transfer learning-based wound assessment solution, which can predict both wound variables from wound images and their healing trajectories, which is our primary contribution. We argue that the development of a novel model can help in early detection of the complexities in the wound, which might affect the healing process and also reduce the time spent by a clinician to diagnose the wound.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4f4f\u9662\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f24\u53e3\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0e\u4f24\u53e3\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u4f24\u53e3\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u5176\u6108\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u4f4f\u9662\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u4f24\u53e3\u62a4\u7406\u8d39\u7528\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u60a3\u8005\u4f4f\u9662\uff0c\u800c\u8bb8\u591a\u4f4f\u9662\u60c5\u51b5\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u6cbb\u7597\u5ef6\u8bef\u3001\u60a3\u8005\u4f9d\u4ece\u6027\u5dee\u6216\u5408\u5e76\u75c7\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f24\u53e3\u6076\u5316\u6240\u81f4\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u65e9\u671f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4f\u9662\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u8bca\u7597\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f24\u53e3\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6784\u5efa\u4f24\u53e3\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u4f24\u53e3\u53d8\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u6108\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u60a3\u8005\u4f4f\u9662\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bca\u65ad\u4f24\u53e3\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f24\u53e3\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u6108\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u8bca\u65ad\u6240\u9700\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

However, these Long CoTs are often excessively lengthy and contain redundant reasoning steps, which can hinder inference efficiency. Compressing these long CoTs is a natural solution, yet existing approaches face two major challenges: (1) they may compromise the integrity of visual-textual reasoning by removing essential alignment cues, and (2) the compression process lacks explainability, making it difficult to discern which information is critical. To address these problems, we propose XMCC, an eXplainable Multimodal CoT Compressor that formulates compression as a sequential decision-making process optimized via reinforcement learning. XMCC can effectively shorten reasoning trajectories while preserving key reasoning steps and answer correctness, and simultaneously generates natural-language explanations for its compression decisions.

However, these models may not be similar in medical imaging, where abnormal regions cover only a small portion of the image. This challenge motivates this study to investigate the latest deep models for bladder cancer classification tasks. We propose the following to evaluate these deep models: 1) standard classification using 13 models (four CNNs and eight transormer-based models), 2) calibration analysis to examine if these models are well calibrated for bladder cancer classification, and 3) we use GradCAM++ to evaluate the interpretability of these models for clinical diagnosis. We simulate $\\sim 300$ experiments on a publicly multicenter bladder cancer dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that the ConvNext series indicate limited generalization ability to classify bladder cancer images (e.g., $\\sim 60\\%$ accuracy). In addition, ViTs show better calibration effects compared to ConvNext and swin transformer series. We also involve test time augmentation to improve the models interpretability. Finally, no model provides a one-size-fits-all solution for a feasible interpretable model.

Evaluating them requires approximating a large number of conditional expectations, either via Monte Carlo integration or regression.

Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime.

In this paper, we introduce the Kyrtos methodology for the automatic recognition and analysis of charts with curves in graphics images of technical documents. The recognition processing part adopts a clustering based approach to recognize middle-points that delimit the line-segments that construct the illustrated curves. The analysis processing part parses the extracted line-segments of curves to capture behavioral features such as direction, trend and etc. These associations assist the conversion of recognized segments' relations into attributed graphs, for the preservation of the curves' structural characteristics. The graph relations are also are expressed into natural language (NL) text sentences, enriching the document's text and facilitating their conversion into Stochastic Petri-net (SPN) graphs, which depict the internal functionality represented in the chart image.

The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration. Thus, we propose a fully Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework, which seamlessly integrates and enhances four critical SSL components: supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation.

The usual specification of constraints in most CASP solvers is closer to the numerical back-end expressiveness and semantics, rather than to standard specification in ASP. In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values. In CASP, most (if not all) of these features are lost once we switch to a constraint-based representation of those same attributes. In this paper, we present the FLINGO language (and tool) that incorporates the aforementioned expressiveness inside the numerical constraints and we illustrate its use with several examples.

Image-to-3D foundations models can solve this issue by reconstructing 3D data from 2D modalites. Current foundation models are trained on natural image distributions to reconstruct naturalistic objects from a single image by leveraging geometric priors across pixels. However, it is unclear whether these learned geometric priors transfer to medical data. In this study, we present a controlled zero-shot benchmark of single slice medical image-to-3D reconstruction across five state-of-the-art image-to-3D models: SAM3D, Hunyuan3D-2.1, Direct3D, Hi3DGen, and TripoSG. These are evaluated across six medical datasets spanning anatomical and pathological structures and two natrual datasets, using voxel based metrics and point cloud distance metrics. Across medical datasets, voxel based overlap remains moderate for all models, consistent with a depth reconstruction failure mode when inferring volume from a single slice. In contrast, global distance metrics show more separation between methods: SAM3D achieves the strongest overall topological similarity to ground truth medical 3D data, while alternative models are more prone to over-simplication of reconstruction. Our results quantify the limits of single-slice medical reconstruction and highlight depth ambiguity caused by the planar nature of 2D medical data, motivating multi-view image-to-3D reconstruction to enable reliable medical 3D inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u524d\u6cbf\u7684\u5355\u56fe\u52303D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ece\u5355\u5f202D\u533b\u5b66\u5207\u7247\u91cd\u5efa3D\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u4f53\u79ef\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dSAM3D\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b663D\u6210\u50cf\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u901a\u75283D\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9SAM3D\u3001Hunyuan3D-2.1\u3001Direct3D\u3001Hi3DGen\u548cTripoSG\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5355\u5207\u72473D\u91cd\u5efa\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4f53\u7d20\u91cd\u53e0\u6307\u6807\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u8ddd\u79bb\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u4f53\u7d20\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u4ec5\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7b49\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u5207\u7247\u63a8\u65ad\u4f53\u79ef\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0cSAM3D\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u5207\u7247\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u52303D\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e2D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u533b\u5b663D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

While the crowdsourced Arena platforms offer human preference assessments by collecting human votes, they are costly and time-consuming, inherently limiting their scalability. Leveraging vision-language model (VLMs) as substitutes for manual judgments presents a promising solution. However, the inherent hallucinations and biases of VLMs hinder alignment with human preferences, thus compromising evaluation reliability. Additionally, the static evaluation approach lead to low efficiency. In this paper, we propose K-Sort Eval, a reliable and efficient VLM-based evaluation framework that integrates posterior correction and dynamic matching. Specifically, we curate a high-quality dataset from thousands of human votes in K-Sort Arena, with each instance containing the outputs and rankings of K models. When evaluating a new model, it undergoes (K+1)-wise free-for-all comparisons with existing models, and the VLM provide the rankings. To enhance alignment and reliability, we propose a posterior correction method, which adaptively corrects the posterior probability in Bayesian updating based on the consistency between the VLM prediction and human supervision. Moreover, we propose a dynamic matching strategy, which balances uncertainty and diversity to maximize the expected benefit of each comparison, thus ensuring more efficient evaluation. Extensive experiments show that K-Sort Eval delivers evaluation results consistent with K-Sort Arena, typically requiring fewer than 90 model runs, demonstrating both its efficiency and reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faK-Sort Eval\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u9a8c\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u8fd0\u884c\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f17\u5305\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u53c8\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u6295\u7968\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfK-Sort Arena\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5df2\u6709K\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c(K+1)\u8def\u81ea\u7531\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u7531VLM\u7ed9\u51fa\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u540e\u9a8c\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636eVLM\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6bcf\u6b21\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u9884\u671f\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cK-Sort Eval\u80fd\u4ee5\u5c11\u4e8e90\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u8fd0\u884c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0eK-Sort Arena\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "K-Sort Eval\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u540e\u9a8c\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86VLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGHS-TDA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u5047\u8bbe\u56fe\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9010\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u65e9\u671f\u9519\u8bef\u6613\u4f20\u64ad\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u4fee\u6b63\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u6790\u624b\u6bb5\u4ee5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "GHS-TDA\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5047\u8bbe\u56fe\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u7ea0\u9519\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u4e0e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u9aa8\u67b6\u3002", "result": "GHS-TDA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0cGHS-TDA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfCoT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Under a unified set of assumptions combining blockwise Lipschitz geometry, local identifiability, and sub-Gaussian noise, we establish deterministic stability inequalities, global Lipschitz bounds for least-squares misfit functionals, and nonasymptotic concentration estimates. These results yield high-probability parameter error bounds that are intrinsic to the forward operator and independent of any specific reconstruction algorithm. As a concrete instantiation, we verify that the Gaussian Splatting rendering operator satisfies the proposed assumptions and derive explicit constants governing its Lipschitz continuity and resolution-dependent observability.

Inferring Willingness to Pay from Subjective Choices", "comment": null, "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications such as travel assistance and purchasing support, they are often required to make subjective choices on behalf of users in settings where no objectively correct answer exists. We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks.

To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions.

Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points.

In this work, we present Fine-T2I, a large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for T2I fine-tuning. Fine-T2I spans 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates, and combines synthetic images generated by strong modern models with carefully curated real images from professional photographers. All samples are rigorously filtered for text-image alignment, visual fidelity, and prompt quality, with over 95% of initial candidates removed. The final dataset contains over 6 million text-image pairs, around 2 TB on disk, approaching the scale of pretraining datasets while maintaining fine-tuning-level quality. Across a diverse set of pretrained diffusion and autoregressive models, fine-tuning on Fine-T2I consistently improves both generation quality and instruction adherence, as validated by human evaluation, visual comparison, and automatic metrics.

We propose Differential Reasoning Learning (DRL), a framework that improves clinical agents by learning from reasoning discrepancies. From reference reasoning rationales (e.g., physician-authored clinical rationale, clinical guidelines, or outputs from more capable models) and the agent's free-form chain-of-thought (CoT), DRL extracts reasoning graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and performs a clinically weighted graph edit distance (GED)-based discrepancy analysis. An LLM-as-a-judge aligns semantically equivalent nodes and diagnoses discrepancies between graphs. These graph-level discrepancy diagnostics are converted into natural-language instructions and stored in a Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base (DR-KB). At inference, we retrieve top-$k$ instructions via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to augment the agent prompt and patch likely logic gaps. Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach.

We introduce Early-Stopping for Token-Aware Reasoning (ESTAR), which detects and reduces such reasoning redundancy to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Our method combines (i) a trajectory-based classifier that identifies when reasoning can be safely stopped, (ii) supervised fine-tuning to teach LRMs to propose self-generated <stop> signals, and (iii) <stop>-aware reinforcement learning that truncates rollouts at self-generated stop points with compute-aware rewards. Experiments on four reasoning datasets show that ESTAR reduces reasoning length by about 3.7x (from 4,799 to 1,290) while preserving accuracy (74.9% vs. 74.2%), with strong cross-domain generalization.

This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs. Specifically, we synthesize programs that operate on simulation logs and map them to a series of high level activated patterns. We show, through two physics benchmarks, that this annotated representation of the simulation log is more amenable to natural language reasoning about physical systems. We demonstrate how this method enables LMs to generate effective reward programs from goals specified in natural language, which may be used within the context of planning or supervised learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u201c\u521a\u4f53\u78b0\u649e\u201d\u3001\u201c\u7a33\u5b9a\u652f\u6491\u201d\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u64c5\u957f\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ec5\u6765\u81ea\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u4eff\u771f\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53c8\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5904\u7406\u8be6\u7ec6\u4eff\u771f\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u8be5\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u5316\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u793a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212\u6216\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4eff\u771f\u65e5\u5fd7\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\\% and 4.72\\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

Unpaired synthetic-to-real translation can reduce this gap without paired supervision, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between photorealism and structural stability: unconstrained generation may introduce deformation or spurious textures, while overly rigid constraints limit adaptation to real-domain statistics. We propose FD-DB, a frequency-decoupled dual-branch model that separates appearance transfer into low-frequency interpretable editing and high-frequency residual compensation. The interpretable branch predicts physically meaningful editing parameters (white balance, exposure, contrast, saturation, blur, and grain) to build a stable low-frequency appearance base with strong content preservation. The free branch complements fine details through residual generation, and a gated fusion mechanism combines the two branches under explicit frequency constraints to limit low-frequency drift. We further adopt a two-stage training schedule that first stabilizes the editing branch and then releases the residual branch to improve optimization stability. Experiments on the YCB-V dataset show that FD-DB improves real-domain appearance consistency and significantly boosts downstream semantic segmentation performance while preserving geometric and semantic structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFD-DB\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u867d\u5177\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u6807\u6ce8\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u57df\u504f\u79fb\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u3002", "method": "FD-DB\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u652f\u9884\u6d4b\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u767d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u66dd\u5149\u7b49\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u9891\u7a33\u5b9a\u5916\u89c2\u57fa\u5e95\uff1b\u81ea\u7531\u5206\u652f\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u751f\u6210\u8865\u5145\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u9891\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728YCB-V\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFD-DB\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8f83\u597d\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "FD-DB\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u89e3\u8026\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u5916\u89c2\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u903c\u771f\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average.

Knudsen", "Tolga Tasdizen"], "title": "Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning for Histopathology Patch Embeddings", "comment": null, "summary": "Digital histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) provide gigapixel-scale high-resolution images that are highly useful for disease diagnosis. However, digital histopathology image analysis faces significant challenges due to the limited training labels, since manually annotating specific regions or small patches cropped from large WSIs requires substantial time and effort. Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a practical and efficient solution by requiring only bag-level (slide-level) labels, while each bag typically contains multiple instances (patches). Most MIL methods directly use frozen image patch features generated by various image encoders as inputs and primarily focus on feature aggregation. However, feature representation learning for encoder pretraining in MIL settings has largely been neglected.\n  In our work, we propose a novel feature representation learning framework called weakly supervised contrastive learning (WeakSupCon) that incorporates bag-level label information during training. Our method does not rely on instance-level pseudo-labeling, yet it effectively separates patches with different labels in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the image features generated by our WeakSupCon method lead to improved downstream MIL performance compared to self-supervised contrastive learning approaches in three datasets.

However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization.

Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution for compressing these models, but existing methods primarily rely on static next-token alignment, neglecting the dynamic token interactions, which embed essential capabilities for multimodal understanding and generation. To this end, we introduce Align-TI, a novel KD framework designed from the perspective of Token Interactions. Our approach is motivated by the insight that MLLMs rely on two primary interactions: vision-instruction token interactions to extract relevant visual information, and intra-response token interactions for coherent generation. Accordingly, Align-TI introduces two components: IVA enables the student model to imitate the teacher's instruction-relevant visual information extract capability by aligning on salient visual regions. TPA captures the teacher's dynamic generative logic by aligning the sequential token-to-token transition probabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate Align-TI's superiority. Notably, our approach achieves $2.6\\%$ relative improvement over Vanilla KD, and our distilled Align-TI-2B even outperforms LLaVA-1.5-7B (a much larger MLLM) by $7.0\\%$, establishing a new state-of-the-art distillation framework for training parameter-efficient MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lchen1019/Align-TI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAlign-TI\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eToken\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00token\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u52a8\u6001token\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "Align-TI\u4ecetoken\u4ea4\u4e92\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aIVA\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u663e\u8457\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u4eff\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u76f8\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1bTPA\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u7684token\u5230token\u8f6c\u79fb\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAlign-TI\u76f8\u6bd4Vanilla KD\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u53472.6%\uff0c\u5176\u84b8\u998f\u51fa\u7684Align-TI-2B\u6a21\u578b\u751a\u81f3\u6bd4\u66f4\u5927\u7684LLaVA-1.5-7B\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u51fa7.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "Align-TI\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684MLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

Its goal was to assess how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks: generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes (FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies. Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss design.

Recently, several supervised CL methods have been proposed to promote an ideal regular simplex geometric configuration in the representation space-characterized by intra-class feature collapse and uniform inter-class mean spacing, especially for imbalanced datasets. In particular, existing prototype-based methods include class prototypes, as additional samples to consider all classes. However, the existing CL methods suffer from two limitations. First, they do not consider the alignment between the class means/prototypes and classifiers, which could lead to poor generalization. Second, existing prototype-based methods treat prototypes as only one additional sample per class, making their influence depend on the number of class instances in a batch and causing unbalanced contributions across classes. To address these limitations, we propose Equilibrium Contrastive Learning (ECL), a supervised CL framework designed to promote geometric equilibrium, where class features, means, and classifiers are harmoniously balanced under data imbalance. The proposed ECL framework uses two main components. First, ECL promotes the representation geometric equilibrium (i.e., a regular simplex geometry characterized by collapsed class samples and uniformly distributed class means), while balancing the contributions of class-average features and class prototypes. Second, ECL establishes a classifier-class center geometric equilibrium by aligning classifier weights and class prototypes. We ran experiments with three long-tailed datasets, the CIFAR-10(0)-LT, ImageNet-LT, and the two imbalanced medical datasets, the ISIC 2019 and our constructed LCCT dataset.

Unlike conventional approaches that directly regress depth values and often exhibit artifacts under severe or unknown degradation, AdaDS capitalizes on the contraction property of Gaussian smoothing: as noise accumulates in the forward process, distributional discrepancies between degraded inputs and their pristine high-quality counterparts diminish, ultimately converging to isotropic Gaussian prior. Leveraging this, AdaDS adaptively selects a starting timestep in the reverse diffusion trajectory based on estimated refinement uncertainty, and subsequently injects tailored noise to position the intermediate sample within the high-probability region of the target posterior distribution. This strategy ensures inherent robustness, enabling generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model to dominate recovery even when upstream estimations are imperfect.

Liao", "Chien-Chang Chen", "Hen-Hsen Huang", "Hong-Yuan Mark Liao"], "title": "A Universal Action Space for General Behavior Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Analyzing animal and human behavior has long been a challenging task in computer vision. Early approaches from the 1970s to the 1990s relied on hand-crafted edge detection, segmentation, and low-level features such as color, shape, and texture to locate objects and infer their identities-an inherently ill-posed problem. Behavior analysis in this era typically proceeded by tracking identified objects over time and modeling their trajectories using sparse feature points, which further limited robustness and generalization. A major shift occurred with the introduction of ImageNet by Deng and Li in 2010, which enabled large-scale visual recognition through deep neural networks and effectively served as a comprehensive visual dictionary. This development allowed object recognition to move beyond complex low-level processing toward learned high-level representations. In this work, we follow this paradigm to build a large-scale Universal Action Space (UAS) using existing labeled human-action datasets. We then use this UAS as the foundation for analyzing and categorizing mammalian and chimpanzee behavior datasets.

To alleviate this problem, some previous studies adjust and amplify visual attention. These methods present a limitation that boosting attention for all visual tokens inevitably increases attention to task irrelevant tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose a training free attentional intervention algorithm to enhance the attention of task-relevant tokens based on the argument that task-relevant tokens generally demonstrate high visual-textual similarities. Specifically, the vision-text cross-attention submatrices, which represent visual-textual correlations, are extracted to construct the reweighting matrices to reallocate attention. Besides, to enhance the contribution of visual tokens, we inject visual attention values into the beam search decoding to identify solutions with higher visual attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method significantly reduces hallucinations across mainstream LVLMs, while preserving the accuracy and coherence of generated content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u89c6\u89c9token\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u503c\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173token\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173token\u901a\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u77e9\u9635\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u89e3\u7801\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u503c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9token\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LVLM\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3LVLM\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, their use in high-stakes fields like healthcare remains limited due to persistent hallucinations, where generated text contradicts or ignores visual input. We contend that MLLMs can comprehend images but struggle to produce accurate token sequences. Minor perturbations can shift attention from truthful to untruthful states, and the autoregressive nature of text generation often prevents error correction.

We identify that the root cause of this limitation lies in the lack of reliable distortion priors, as methods typically learn shallow relationships between unified image features and quality scores, resulting in their insensitive nature to distortions and thus limiting their performance. To address this, we introduce DR.Experts, a novel prior-driven BIQA framework designed to explicitly incorporate distortion priors, enabling a reliable quality assessment. DR.Experts begins by leveraging a degradation-aware vision-language model to obtain distortion-specific priors, which are further refined and enhanced by the proposed Distortion-Saliency Differential Module through distinguishing them from semantic attentions, thereby ensuring the genuine representations of distortions. The refined priors, along with semantics and bridging representation, are then fused by a proposed mixture-of-experts style module named the Dynamic Distortion Weighting Module. This mechanism weights each distortion-specific feature as per its perceptual impact, ensuring that the final quality prediction aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging BIQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DR.Experts over current methods and showcase its excellence in terms of generalization and data efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDR.Experts\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u76f2\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08BIQA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5931\u771f\u5148\u9a8c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709BIQA\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u5931\u771f\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e3b\u89c2\u5224\u65ad\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5176\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5931\u771f\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "DR.Experts\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u9000\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u7279\u5b9a\u5931\u771f\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5931\u771f\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u533a\u5206\u5f00\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5931\u771f\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u878d\u5408\u5931\u771f\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6865\u63a5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6309\u611f\u77e5\u5f71\u54cd\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u5404\u5931\u771f\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684BIQA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDR.Experts\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5931\u771f\u5148\u9a8c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cDR.Experts\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4e3aBIQA\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens.

Current methods struggle with nuanced emotional expressions due to the lack of fine-grained emotion control. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage method (AUHead) to disentangle fine-grained emotion control, i.e. , Action Units (AUs), from audio and achieve controllable generation. In the first stage, we explore the AU generation abilities of large audio-language models (ALMs), by spatial-temporal AU tokenization and an \"emotion-then-AU\" chain-of-thought mechanism. It aims to disentangle AUs from raw speech, effectively capturing subtle emotional cues. In the second stage, we propose an AU-driven controllable diffusion model that synthesizes realistic talking-head videos conditioned on AU sequences. Specifically, we first map the AU sequences into the structured 2D facial representation to enhance spatial fidelity, and then model the AU-vision interaction within cross-attention modules. To achieve flexible AU-quality trade-off control, we introduce an AU disentanglement guidance strategy during inference, further refining the emotional expressiveness and identity consistency of the generated videos. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance in emotional realism, accurate lip synchronization, and visual coherence, significantly surpassing existing techniques.

However, due to the strong prior of large language models (LLMs) and misaligned attention across modalities, LVLMs often generate outputs inconsistent with visual content - termed hallucination. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Scalpel}, a method that reduces hallucination by refining attention activation distributions toward more credible regions. Scalpel predicts trusted attention directions for each head in Transformer layers during inference and adjusts activations accordingly. It employs a Gaussian mixture model to capture multi-peak distributions of attention in trust and hallucination manifolds, and uses entropic optimal transport (equivalent to Schr\u00f6dinger bridge problem) to map Gaussian components precisely. During mitigation, Scalpel dynamically adjusts intervention strength and direction based on component membership and mapping relationships between hallucination and trust activations. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and benchmarks demonstrate that Scalpel effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming previous methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, Scalpel is model- and data-agnostic, requiring no additional computation, only a single decoding step.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faScalpel\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8c03\u6574Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff08\u5373\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Scalpel\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u523b\u753b\u53ef\u4fe1\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u591a\u5cf0\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8eSchr\u00f6dinger\u6865\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u7cbe\u786e\u6620\u5c04\u9ad8\u65af\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5e72\u9884\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cScalpel\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "Scalpel\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u7c7bLVLM\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5355\u6b21\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

As a virtual sandbox, the GUI World model empowers agents with human-like foresight by enabling action-conditioned prediction. However, existing text- and pixel-based approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural controllability. To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation. Specifically, to address the data scarcity problem, we construct AndroidCode by translating GUI trajectories into high-fidelity HTML and refining synthesized code through a visual-feedback revision mechanism, yielding a corpus of over 80K high-quality screen-action pairs. To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Code2World-8B achieves the top-performing next UI prediction, rivaling the competitive GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image. Notably, Code2World significantly enhances downstream navigation success rates in a flexible manner, boosting Gemini-2.5-Flash by +9.5% on AndroidWorld navigation.

The vast majority of approaches to spectral clustering are driven by a single modality, leaving the rich information in multi-modal representations untapped. Inspired by the recent success of vision-language pre-training, this paper enriches the landscape of spectral clustering from a single-modal to a multi-modal regime. Particularly, we propose Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering that leverages cross-modal alignment in pre-trained vision-language models. By anchoring the neural tangent kernel with positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, we arrive at formulating the affinity between images as a coupling of their visual proximity and semantic overlap. We show that this formulation amplifies within-cluster connections while suppressing spurious ones across clusters, hence encouraging block-diagonal structures. In addition, we present a regularized affinity diffusion mechanism that adaptively ensembles affinity matrices induced by different prompts.

The variability in the 3D Morphable models can be controlled by tuning diverse parameters. They are high-level image descriptors, such as shape, texture, illumination, and camera parameters. Previous research in 3D human reconstruction concentrated solely on global face structure or geometry, ignoring face semantic features such as age, gender, and facial landmarks characterizing facial boundaries, curves, dips, and wrinkles. In order to accommodate changes in these high-level facial characteristics, this work introduces a shape and appearance-aware 3D reconstruction system (named SARS by us), a c modular pipeline that extracts body and face information from a single image to properly rebuild the 3D model of the human full body.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSARS\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4eba\u4f53\u4e0e\u9762\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u9762\u90e8\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\uff09\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u4eba\u4f533D\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6574\u4f53\u9762\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u548c\u9762\u90e8\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u7b49\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4e3a\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebfSARS\uff0c\u5229\u75283D\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\uff083DMM\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0e\u8868\u60c5\u6df7\u5408\u5f62\u72b6\u53ca\u57fa\u7840\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u5f202D\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9762\u90e8\u4e0e\u8eab\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec6\u8282\uff08\u5982\u76b1\u7eb9\u3001\u8f6e\u5ed3\u3001\u51f9\u9677\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u4eba\u4f533D\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9636\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SARS\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4f20\u7edf3DMM\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u4e0e\u8eab\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e863D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing methods rely on deep models to directly predict normal maps. However, they often suffer from 3D misalignment: while the estimated normal maps may appear to have a correct appearance, the reconstructed surfaces often fail to align with the geometric details. We argue that this misalignment stems from the current paradigm: the model struggles to distinguish and reconstruct varying geometry represented in normal maps, as the differences in underlying geometry are reflected only through relatively subtle color variations. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm that reformulates normal estimation as shading sequence estimation, where shading sequences are more sensitive to various geometric information. Building on this paradigm, we present RoSE, a method that leverages image-to-video generative models to predict shading sequences. The predicted shading sequences are then converted into normal maps by solving a simple ordinary least-squares problem. To enhance robustness and better handle complex objects, RoSE is trained on a synthetic dataset, MultiShade, with diverse shapes, materials, and light conditions. Experiments demonstrate that RoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmark datasets for object-based monocular normal estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRoSE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u76ee\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5bf9\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7740\u8272\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7740\u8272\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6cd5\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u76ee\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5916\u89c2\u5408\u7406\u7684\u6cd5\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u91cd\u5efa\u8868\u9762\u5e38\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u5b58\u57283D\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u989c\u8272\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u533a\u5206\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u5c06\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7740\u8272\u5e8f\u5217\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08RoSE\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u7740\u8272\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u666e\u901a\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u95ee\u9898\u5c06\u7740\u8272\u5e8f\u5217\u8f6c\u4e3a\u6cd5\u7ebf\u56fe\uff1b\u5728\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6837\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u548c\u5149\u7167\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6MultiShade\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7269\u4f53\u7ea7\u5355\u76ee\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRoSE\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u7740\u8272\u5e8f\u5217\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e33D\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u76ee\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Pl\u00fccker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis.

Accepted at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2026", "summary": "Evaluating lesion evolution in longitudinal CT scans of can cer patients is essential for assessing treatment response, yet establishing reliable lesion correspondence across time remains challenging. Standard bipartite matchers, which rely on geometric proximity, struggle when lesions appear, disappear, merge, or split. We propose a registration-aware matcher based on unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) that accommodates unequal lesion mass and adapts priors to patient-level tumor-load changes.

However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTele-Omni\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u9891\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u3002", "method": "Tele-Omni\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u6790\u5f02\u6784\u6307\u4ee4\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6216\u7f16\u8f91\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u518d\u7531\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6839\u636e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u6784\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTele-Omni\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u9996\u5c3e\u5e27\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6307\u4ee4\u89e3\u6790\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0cTele-Omni\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

While blood vessels visible during endoscopy offer a patient-specific \"vascular fingerprint\" for navigation, automated segmentation is challenged by imperfect endoscopic data, including sparse labels, artifacts like bubbles or variable lighting, continuous deformation, and mucosal folds that mimic vessels. State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods often fail to address these domain-specific complexities. We introduce a Hybrid Attention-Convolution (HAC) architecture that combines Transformers to capture global vessel topology prior with a CNN that learns a residual refinement map to precisely recover thin-vessel details. To prioritize structural connectivity, the Transformer is trained on optimized ground truth data that exclude short and terminal branches. Furthermore, to address data scarcity, we employ a physics-aware pretraining, that is a self-supervised strategy using clinically grounded augmentations on unlabeled data. Evaluated on the BlaVeS dataset, consisting of endoscopic video frames, our approach achieves high accuracy (0.94) and superior precision (0.61) and clDice (0.66) compared to state-of-the-art medical segmentation models.

However, existing solutions for video hate detection either rely heavily on large-scale human annotations or lack fine-grained temporal precision. In this work, we propose LELA, the first training-free Large Language Model (LLM) based framework for hate video localization. Distinct from state-of-the-art models that depend on supervised pipelines, LELA leverages LLMs and modality-specific captioning to detect and temporally localize hateful content in a training-free manner. Our method decomposes a video into five modalities, including image, speech, OCR, music, and video context, and uses a multi-stage prompting scheme to compute fine-grained hateful scores for each frame.

To alleviate this predicament, we collect a comprehensive video-based 3D affordance dataset, \\textit{VIDA}, which contains 38K human-object-interaction videos covering 16 affordance types, 38 object categories, and 22K point clouds. Based on \\textit{VIDA}, we propose a strong baseline: VideoAfford, which activates multimodal large language models with additional affordance segmentation capabilities, enabling both world knowledge reasoning and fine-grained affordance grounding within a unified framework. To enhance action understanding capability, we leverage a latent action encoder to extract dynamic interaction priors from HOI videos. Moreover, we introduce a \\textit{spatial-aware} loss function to enable VideoAfford to obtain comprehensive 3D spatial knowledge.

Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on both pretraining and post-training tasks across synthetic and real benchmarks show that SCD significantly improves throughput and per-frame latency while matching or surpassing the generation quality of strong causal diffusion baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784SCD\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u9010\u5e27\u6e32\u67d3\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u67e5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u3001\u6df1\u5c42\u4e3b\u8981\u6267\u884c\u5e27\u5185\u6e32\u67d3\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSeparable Causal Diffusion\uff08SCD\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u7684\u5e27\u95f4\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u518d\u7531\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5b8c\u6210\u591a\u6b65\u5e27\u5185\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSCD\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5355\u5e27\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5ab2\u7f8e\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\uff0cSCD\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u4e8c\u8005\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$\u0394$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video.

In reality, the exploration process of a CUA across apps/desktops/web pages typically follows a tree structure, with earlier functional entry points often being explored more frequently. Thus, organizing large-scale trajectories into tree structures can reduce data cost and streamline the data scaling of GUI planning. In this work, we propose TreeCUA to efficiently scale GUI automation with tree-structured verifiable evolution. We propose a multi-agent collaborative framework to explore the environment, verify actions, summarize trajectories, and evaluate quality to generate high-quality and scalable GUI trajectories. To improve efficiency, we devise a novel tree-based topology to store and replay duplicate exploration nodes, and design an adaptive exploration algorithm to balance the depth (\\emph{i.e.}, trajectory difficulty) and breadth (\\emph{i.e.}, trajectory diversity). Moreover, we develop world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to avoid low-quality generation. Finally, we naturally extend and propose the TreeCUA-DPO method from abundant tree node information, improving GUI planning capability by referring to the branch information of adjacent trajectories.

Based on the CARE Liver 2025 Track 4 Challenge, this study introduces a multi-task deep learning framework developed for liver segmentation (LiSeg) and liver fibrosis staging (LiFS) using multiparametric MRI. The LiSeg phase addresses the challenge of limited annotated images and the complexities of multi-parametric MRI data by employing a semi-supervised learning model that integrates image segmentation and registration. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model overcomes the difficulties introduced by domain shifts and variations across modalities. In the LiFS phase, we employed a patchbased method which allows the visualization of liver fibrosis stages based on the classification outputs. Our approach effectively handles multimodality imaging data, limited labels, and domain shifts. The proposed method has been tested by the challenge organizer on an independent test set that includes in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) cases using three-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI) and seven-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI, GED1-GED4).

However, existing 3D generation methods face challenges in generating animatable geometry, while rigging techniques lack fine-grained structural control over skeleton creation. To address these limitations, we introduce Stroke3D, a novel framework that directly generates rigged meshes from user inputs: 2D drawn strokes and a descriptive text prompt. Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes.

In particular, automated detection of craquelure in digitized paintings is crucial for assessing degradation and guiding restoration, yet remains challenging due to the possibly complex scenery and the visual similarity between cracks and crack-like artistic features such as brush strokes or hair. We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior. Joint optimization yields a pixel-level map of crack localizations in the painting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u88c2\u7eb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eMumford\u2013Shah\u578b\u53d8\u5206\u6cdb\u51fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u7ed8\u753b\u4e2d\u88c2\u7eb9\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u7ed8\u753b\u4e2d\u7684\u88c2\u7eb9\uff08craquelure\uff09\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u827a\u672f\u54c1\u9000\u5316\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u4fee\u590d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u88c2\u7eb9\u4e0e\u7b14\u89e6\u3001\u53d1\u4e1d\u7b49\u827a\u672f\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u88c2\u7eb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c6\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u88c2\u7eb9\u753b\u4f5c\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528Mumford\u2013Shah\u578b\u53d8\u5206\u6cdb\u51fd\u7ed3\u5408\u88c2\u7eb9\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u88c2\u7eb9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u83b7\u5f97\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u88c2\u7eb9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u753b\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u88c2\u7eb9\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u88c2\u7eb9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u56fe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u827a\u672f\u54c1\u7684\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u53d8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u88c2\u7eb9\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u827a\u672f\u54c1\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We geographically profile large-scale multimodal datasets by mapping image-caption pairs to countries based on location information extracted from captions using LLMs. Studying English captions from three widely used datasets (Re-LAION, DataComp1B, and Conceptual Captions) across $20$ common entities (e.g., house, flag), we find that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada account for $48.0\\%$ of samples, while South American and African countries are severely under-represented with only $1.8\\%$ and $3.8\\%$ of images, respectively. We observe a strong correlation between a country's GDP and its representation in the data ($\u03c1= 0.82$). Examining non-English subsets for $4$ languages from the Re-LAION dataset, we find that representation skews heavily toward countries where these languages are predominantly spoken. Additionally, we find that higher representation does not necessarily translate to greater visual or semantic diversity. Finally, analyzing country-specific images generated by Stable Diffusion v1.3 trained on Re-LAION, we show that while generations appear realistic, they are severely limited in their coverage compared to real-world images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u6d41\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u5411\u9ad8\u6536\u5165\u82f1\u8bed\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5357\u7f8e\u548c\u975e\u6d32\u7b49\u5730\u533a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u56fd\u5bb6GDP\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5730\u7406\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u5373\u5176\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u662f\u5426\u5728\u5730\u7406\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e38\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Re-LAION\u3001DataComp1B\u3001Conceptual Captions\uff09\u7684\u82f1\u6587\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u9898\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5bf9\u5e94\u56fd\u5bb6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790Re-LAION\u4e2d\u56db\u79cd\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30Stable Diffusion v1.3\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5730\u7406\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7f8e\u56fd\u3001\u82f1\u56fd\u548c\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u5360\u6837\u672c\u603b\u91cf\u768448.0%\uff0c\u800c\u5357\u7f8e\u548c\u975e\u6d32\u56fd\u5bb6\u5206\u522b\u4ec5\u53601.8%\u548c3.8%\uff1b\u56fd\u5bb6GDP\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u03c1=0.82\uff09\uff1b\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u8be5\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u56fd\uff1b\u9ad8\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1bStable Diffusion\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u867d\u903c\u771f\uff0c\u4f46\u5730\u7406\u8986\u76d6\u8fdc\u4e0d\u5982\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u5168\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5730\u7406\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u5168\u7403\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks either rely on image-centric or subjective metrics insensitive to structure, or evaluate intermediate symbolic representations rather than final rendered images, leaving pixel-based diagram generation underexplored. We introduce SciFlow-Bench, a structure-first benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation directly from pixel-level outputs. Built from real scientific PDFs, SciFlow-Bench pairs each source framework figure with a canonical ground-truth graph and evaluates models as black-box image generators under a closed-loop, round-trip protocol that inverse-parses generated diagram images back into structured graphs for comparison. This design enforces evaluation by structural recoverability rather than visual similarity alone, and is enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent system that coordinates planning, perception, and structural reasoning. Experiments show that preserving structural correctness remains a fundamental challenge, particularly for diagrams with complex topology, underscoring the need for structure-aware evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SciFlow-Bench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u8868\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u8f93\u51fa\u9006\u5411\u89e3\u6790\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56fe\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u8868\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u7ed3\u6784\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e3b\u89c2\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u95f4\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u6e32\u67d3\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6e90\u81ea\u771f\u5b9e\u79d1\u5b66PDF\u7684SciFlow-Bench\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6e90\u56fe\u8868\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u5f80\u8fd4\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u534f\u8c03\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u9006\u5411\u89e3\u6790\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u62d3\u6251\u590d\u6742\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u8868\u751f\u6210\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cSciFlow-Bench\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u6027\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "High-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) from real-world videos is crucial for applications such as cultural heritage preservation, digital twins, and immersive media. However, real-world videos typically contain long sequences with irregular camera trajectories and unknown poses, leading to pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortion during reconstruction. Moreover, lossy compression amplifies these issues by introducing inconsistencies that gradually degrade geometry and rendering quality. While recent studies have addressed either long-sequence NVS or unposed reconstruction, compression-aware approaches still focus on specific artifacts or limited scenarios, leaving diverse compression patterns in long videos insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose CompSplat, a compression-aware training framework that explicitly models frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate inter-frame inconsistency and accumulated geometric errors. CompSplat incorporates compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to enhance robustness and geometric consistency, particularly under heavy compression. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Tanks and Temples, Free, and Hike, demonstrate that CompSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and pose accuracy, significantly surpassing most recent state-of-the-art NVS approaches under severe compression conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCompSplat\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u9010\u5e27\u538b\u7f29\u7279\u6027\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u538b\u7f29\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u4f4d\u59ff\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u4f4d\u59ff\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u9519\u4f4d\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "CompSplat\u5f15\u5165\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5e27\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6bcf\u5e27\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u5e27\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u51e0\u4f55\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728Tanks and Temples\u3001Free\u548cHike\u7b49\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCompSplat\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u538b\u7f29\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "CompSplat\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u91cd\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Inspired by the observation that humans are more error-prone when uncertain or hesitant, we investigate how instability in a model 's internal knowledge contributes to LVLM hallucinations. We conduct extensive empirical analyses from three perspectives, namely attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens, and identify three key hallucination patterns: (i) visual activation drift across attention heads, (ii) pronounced knowledge fluctuations across layers, and (iii) visual focus distraction between neighboring output tokens. Building on these findings, we propose Stability-Aware Knowledge-Enhanced Decoding (SAKED), which introduces a layer-wise Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to quantify knowledge stability throughout the model. By contrasting the most stability-aware and stability-agnostic layers, SAKED suppresses decoding noise and dynamically leverages the most reliable internal knowledge for faithful token generation.

To address this gap, we introduce ARK, a benchmark designed to analyze multimodal retrieval from two complementary perspectives: (i) knowledge domains (five domains with 17 subtypes), which characterize the content and expertise retrieval relies on, and (ii) reasoning skills (six categories), which characterize the type of inference over multimodal evidence required to identify the correct candidate. Specifically, ARK evaluates retrieval with both unimodal and multimodal queries and candidates, covering 16 heterogeneous visual data types. To avoid shortcut matching during evaluation, most queries are paired with targeted hard negatives that require multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 23 representative text-based and multimodal retrievers on ARK and observe a pronounced gap between knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive retrieval, with fine-grained visual and spatial reasoning emerging as persistent bottlenecks.

Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation.

First, a retrieval-augmented knowledge module incorporates category-specific textual descriptions into the model input, enabling context-aware reasoning over domain-specific defects. Second, an entropy-driven latent reasoning mechanism conducts iterative exploration within a compact latent space using optimizable latent think tokens, guided by an entropy-based reward that encourages confident and stable predictions. Furthermore, a dynamic visual injection strategy selectively incorporates the most informative image patches into the latent sequence, directing the reasoning process toward regions critical for anomaly detection.

However, existing methods exhibit limited exploitation of temporal correlations, causing noticeable flicker and degraded temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates. In this paper, we propose Free-GVC, a training-free generative video compression framework that reformulates video coding as latent trajectory compression guided by a video diffusion prior. Our method operates at the group-of-pictures (GOP) level, encoding video segments into a compact latent space and progressively compressing them along the diffusion trajectory. To ensure perceptually consistent reconstruction across GOPs, we introduce an Adaptive Quality Control module that dynamically constructs an online rate-perception surrogate model to predict the optimal diffusion step for each GOP. In addition, an Inter-GOP Alignment module establishes frame overlap and performs latent fusion between adjacent groups, thereby mitigating flicker and enhancing temporal coherence. Experiments show that Free-GVC achieves an average of 93.29% BD-Rate reduction in DISTS over the latest neural codec DCVC-RT, and a user study further confirms its superior perceptual quality and temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFree-GVC\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u538b\u7f29GOP\u7ea7\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u8de8GOP\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u95ea\u70c1\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "Free-GVC\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u7531\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u538b\u7f29\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5728GOP\u7ea7\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u4f18\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8GOP\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u90bbGOP\u95f4\u7684\u5e27\u91cd\u53e0\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFree-GVC\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u65b0\u795e\u7ecf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668DCVC-RT\uff0c\u5728DISTS\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u5b9e\u73b093.29%\u7684BD-Rate\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Free-GVC\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u7801\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This work proposes a novel embodied 4D world model that enables geometrically consistent, arbitrary-view RGBD generation: given only a single-view RGBD observation as input, the model imagines the remaining viewpoints, which can then be back-projected and fused to assemble a more complete 3D structure across time. To efficiently learn the multi-view, cross-modality generation, we explicitly design cross-view and cross-modality feature fusion that jointly encourage consistency between RGB and depth and enforce geometric alignment across views. Beyond prediction, converting generated futures into actions is often handled by inverse dynamics, which is ill-posed because multiple actions can explain the same transition. We address this with a test-time action optimization strategy that backpropagates through the generative model to infer a trajectory-level latent best matching the predicted future, and a residual inverse dynamics model that turns this trajectory prior into accurate executable actions. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate strong performance on both 4D scene generation and downstream manipulation, and ablations provide practical insights into the key design choices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5177\u8eab4D\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u89d2RGBD\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u89c6\u89d2RGBD\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u7eaf\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6216\u90e8\u52063D\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u6574\u9884\u6d4b4D\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ece\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff08\u5982\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1RGB\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u52a8\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u83b7\u53d6\u5339\u914d\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6b8b\u5dee\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57284D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5177\u8eab4D\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e864D\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, their massive computational cost and memory footprint hinder deployment on edge devices. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), directly applying existing methods to DiTs yields suboptimal results due to the neglect of the unique temporal dynamics inherent in diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose AdaTSQ, a novel PTQ framework that pushes the Pareto frontier of efficiency and quality by exploiting the temporal sensitivity of DiTs. First, we propose a Pareto-aware timestep-dynamic bit-width allocation strategy. We model the quantization policy search as a constrained pathfinding problem. We utilize a beam search algorithm guided by end-to-end reconstruction error to dynamically assign layer-wise bit-widths across different timesteps. Second, we propose a Fisher-guided temporal calibration mechanism. It leverages temporal Fisher information to prioritize calibration data from highly sensitive timesteps, seamlessly integrating with Hessian-based weight optimization. Extensive experiments on four advanced DiTs (e.g., Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Z-Image, and Wan2.1) demonstrate that AdaTSQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like SVDQuant and ViDiT-Q.

Recent advances in deep learning have shown promise in supporting this training by enabling automatic video-based assessment of surgical skills. However, the development and evaluation of deep learning models is currently hindered by the limited size of available annotated datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Laparoscopic Skill Analysis and Assessment (LASANA) dataset, comprising 1270 stereo video recordings of four basic laparoscopic training tasks. Each recording is annotated with a structured skill rating, aggregated from three independent raters, as well as binary labels indicating the presence or absence of task-specific errors.

This is especially important for German bakeries because freshly baked goods have a very short shelf life. Automating this process can reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and streamline operations. We propose automating this process using an object detection model to identify baked goods from images. However, the large diversity of German baked goods makes fully supervised training prohibitively expensive and limits scalability. Although open-vocabulary detectors (e.g., OWLv2, Grounding DINO) offer lexibility, we demonstrate that they are insufficient for our task. While motivated by bakeries, our work addresses the broader challenges of deploying computer vision in industries, where tasks are specialized and annotated datasets are scarce. We compile dataset splits with varying supervision levels, covering 19 classes of baked goods. We propose two training workflows to train an object detection model with limited supervision. First, we combine OWLv2 and Grounding DINO localization with image-level supervision to train the model in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we improve viewpoint robustness by fine-tuning on video frames annotated using Segment Anything 2 as a pseudo-label propagation model. Using these workflows, we train YOLOv11 for our detection task due to its favorable speed accuracy tradeoff. Relying solely on image-level supervision, the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91. Finetuning with pseudo-labels raises model performance by 19.3% under non-ideal deployment conditions. Combining these workflows trains a model that surpasses our fully-supervised baseline model under non-ideal deployment conditions, despite relying only on image-level supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u79cd\u7c7b\u7e41\u591a\u3001\u4fdd\u8d28\u671f\u77ed\u7684\u5fb7\u56fd\u70d8\u7119\u98df\u54c1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fb7\u56fd\u70d8\u7119\u98df\u54c1\u79cd\u7c7b\u7e41\u591a\u4e14\u4fdd\u8d28\u671f\u6781\u77ed\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u63a7\u5269\u4f59\u4ea7\u54c1\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08\u5982OWLv2\u3001Grounding DINO\uff09\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b19\u7c7b\u70d8\u7119\u98df\u54c1\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u76d1\u7763\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1\uff09\u7ed3\u5408OWLv2\u548cGrounding DINO\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u8fdb\u884c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528Segment Anything 2\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u91c7\u7528YOLOv11\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578bmAP\u8fbe\u52300.91\uff1b\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u90e8\u7f72\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5fae\u8c03\u4f7f\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534719.3%\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u5b9a\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u70d8\u7119\u4e1a\uff09\u4e2d\u56e0\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u501f\u9274\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We further investigate underexplored aspects of the framework, including numerical stability, Gaussian truncation, and gradient approximation. The resulting system, Faster-GS, provides a rigorously optimized algorithm that we evaluate across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Faster-GS achieves up to 5$\\times$ faster training while maintaining visual quality, establishing a new cost-effective and resource efficient baseline for 3DGS optimization.

These frameworks require removing potential identifiers before sharing. But, even after skull stripping, the brain parenchyma contains unique signatures that can match other MRIs from the same participants across databases, posing a privacy risk if additional data features are available. Current regulatory frameworks often mandate evaluating such risks based on the assessment of a certain level of reasonableness. Prior studies have already suggested that a brain MRI could enable participant linkage, but they have relied on training-based or computationally intensive methods.\n  Here, we demonstrate that linking an individual's skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI, which may lead to re-identification if other identifiers are available, is possible using standard preprocessing followed by image similarity computation. Nearly perfect linkage accuracy was achieved in matching data samples across various time intervals, scanner types, spatial resolutions, and acquisition protocols, despite potential cognitive decline, simulating MRI matching across databases.

To address this limitation, we introduce a conformal prediction algorithm to generate adaptive confidence sets for instance segmentation. Given an image and a pixel coordinate query, our algorithm generates a confidence set of instance predictions for that pixel, with a provable guarantee for the probability that at least one of the predictions has high Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) with the true object instance mask.

However, existing models process video frames independently, thus failing to leverage temporal consistency, which could significantly improve both accuracy and stability in dynamic scenes. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention (STA) mechanism that extends transformer attention blocks to incorporate multi-frame context, enabling robust temporal feature representations for video semantic segmentation. Our approach modifies standard self-attention to process spatio-temporal feature sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and requiring minimal changes to existing architectures. STA demonstrates broad applicability across diverse transformer architectures and remains effective across both lightweight and larger-scale models. A comprehensive evaluation on the Cityscapes and BDD100k datasets shows substantial improvements of 9.20 percentage points in temporal consistency metrics and up to 1.76 percentage points in mean intersection over union compared to single-frame baselines.

Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on artifact cues to detect spliced or forged areas, Forensim is designed to capture duplication patterns crucial for understanding context. In scenarios such as protest imagery, detecting only the forged region, for example a duplicated act of violence inserted into a peaceful crowd, can mislead interpretation, highlighting the need for joint source-target localization. Forensim outputs three-class masks (pristine, source, target) and supports detection of both splicing and copy-move forgeries within a unified architecture. We propose a visual state-space model that leverages normalized attention maps to identify internal similarities, paired with a region-based block attention module to distinguish manipulated regions. This design enables end-to-end training and precise localization. Forensim achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks.

This work presents VideoWorld 2, which extends VideoWorld and offers the first investigation into learning transferable knowledge directly from raw real-world videos. At its core, VideoWorld 2 introduces a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM) that decouples action dynamics from visual appearance: a pretrained video diffusion model handles visual appearance modeling, enabling the dLDM to learn latent codes that focus on compact and meaningful task-related dynamics. These latent codes are then modeled autoregressively to learn task policies and support long-horizon reasoning. We evaluate VideoWorld 2 on challenging real-world handcraft making tasks, where prior video generation and latent-dynamics models struggle to operate reliably. Remarkably, VideoWorld 2 achieves up to 70% improvement in task success rate and produces coherent long execution videos. In robotics, we show that VideoWorld 2 can acquire effective manipulation knowledge from the Open-X dataset, which substantially improves task performance on CALVIN.

Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations. We further propose ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted I2V generation framework that augments the first frame with unposed auxiliary views and fuses semantic and structural cues via a dual-stream visual-geometric encoder as well as a text-visual connector, yielding unified conditioning for a Diffusion Transformer backbone. Experiments across ConsIDVid-Bench demonstrate that ConsID-Gen consistently outperforms in multiple metrics, with the best overall performance surpassing leading video generation models like Wan2.1 and HunyuanVideo, delivering superior identity fidelity and temporal coherence under challenging real-world scenarios.

Established classical methods, such as L1-IRLS and Shonan, face limitations including local minima susceptibility and reliance on convex relaxations that fail to preserve the exact manifold geometry, leading to reduced accuracy in high-noise scenarios. We introduce IQARS (Iterative Quantum Annealing for Rotation Synchronization), the first algorithm that reformulates MRA as a sequence of local quadratic non-convex sub-problems executable on quantum annealers after binarization, to leverage inherent hardware advantages. IQARS removes convex relaxation dependence and better preserves non-Euclidean rotation manifold geometry while leveraging quantum tunneling and parallelism for efficient solution space exploration. We evaluate IQARS's performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. While current annealers remain in their nascent phase and only support solving problems of limited scale with constrained performance, we observed that IQARS on D-Wave annealers can already achieve ca. 12% higher accuracy than Shonan, i.e., the best-performing classical method evaluated empirically.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faIQARS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u591a\u65cb\u8f6c\u5e73\u5747\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5668\u4e0a\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u975e\u51f8\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Shonan\uff09\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982L1-IRLS\u548cShonan\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u65cb\u8f6c\u5e73\u5747\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u51f8\u677e\u5f1b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cbe\u786e\u4fdd\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIQARS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u65cb\u8f6c\u5e73\u5747\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5c40\u90e8\u4e8c\u6b21\u975e\u51f8\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ecf\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u540e\u53ef\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5668\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u96a7\u7a7f\u4e0e\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f7f\u7528\u51f8\u677e\u5f1b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f53\u524d\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u5668\u89c4\u6a21\u53d7\u9650\uff0cIQARS\u5728D-Wave\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6bd4Shonan\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u7ea612%\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "IQARS\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u65cb\u8f6c\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u65cb\u8f6c\u5e73\u5747\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50-\u7ecf\u5178\u6df7\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, existing scene-generation systems often rely on rule-based or task-specific pipelines, yielding artifacts and physically invalid scenes. We present SAGE, an agentic framework that, given a user-specified embodied task (e.g., \"pick up a bowl and place it on the table\"), understands the intent and automatically generates simulation-ready environments at scale. The agent couples multiple generators for layout and object composition with critics that evaluate semantic plausibility, visual realism, and physical stability. Through iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, it self-refines the scenes until meeting user intent and physical validity. The resulting environments are realistic, diverse, and directly deployable in modern simulators for policy training. Policies trained purely on this data exhibit clear scaling trends and generalize to unseen objects and layouts, demonstrating the promise of simulation-driven scaling for embodied AI.
