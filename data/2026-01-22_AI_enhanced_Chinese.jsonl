It is a self-contained article and can be read independently of Part I. Although the authors have previously published related work, this submission is not a revision or updated version of any earlier paper", "summary": "The study of system complexity primarily has two objectives: to explore underlying patterns and to develop theoretical explanations. Pattern exploration seeks to clarify the mechanisms behind the emergence of system complexity, while theoretical explanations aim to identify the fundamental causes of this complexity. Laws are generally defined as mappings between variables, whereas theories offer causal explanations of system behavior. Agent Based Modeling(ABM) is an important approach for studying complex systems, but it tends to emphasize simulation over experimentation. As a result, ABM often struggles to deeply uncover the governing operational principles. Unlike conventional scenario analysis that relies on human reasoning, computational experiments emphasize counterfactual experiments-that is, creating parallel worlds that simulate alternative \"evolutionary paths\" of real-world events. By systematically adjusting input variables and observing the resulting changes in output variables, computational experiments provide a robust tool for causal inference, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional ABM. Together, these methods offer causal insights into the dynamic evolution of systems. This part can help readers gain a preliminary understanding of the entire computational experiment method, laying the foundation for the subsequent study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5176\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u63ed\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\uff08ABM\uff09\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\uff08ABM\uff09\u4fa7\u91cd\u6a21\u62df\u800c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u63ed\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u539f\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u6574\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u91cf\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u201c\u6f14\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u201d\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u63ed\u793a\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0eABM\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002"}}

An open-source microsimulation is used to project Ireland's population into the future where each individual is defined by a number of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. The model is disaggregated spatially at the Electoral Division level, allowing for analysis of results at that, or any broader geographical scales. Ordinal regression is utilised to predict an individual's self-rated health based on their socio-economic characteristics and this method is shown to match well to Ireland's 2022 distribution of health statuses. Due to differences in the health status distributions of the health microdata and the national data, an alignment technique is proposed to bring predictions closer to real values. It is illustrated for one potential future population that the effects of an ageing population may outweigh other improvements in socio-economic outcomes to disimprove Ireland's mean self-rated health slightly. Health modelling at this kind of granular scale could offer local authorities a chance to predict and combat health issues which may arise in their local populations in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4f53\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4eba\u53e3\u81ea\u8bc4\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f00\u6e90\u5fae\u89c2\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u6709\u5e8f\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7231\u5c14\u5170\u9009\u533a\u5c42\u7ea7\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u5730\u65b9\u5f53\u5c40\u63d0\u524d\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5730\u7406\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u4eba\u7fa4\u81ea\u8bc4\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u8003\u8651\u4eba\u53e3\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u5fae\u89c2\u6a21\u62df\u5c06\u7231\u5c14\u5170\u4eba\u53e3\u6309\u9009\u533a\uff08Electoral Division\uff09\u7ea7\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u672a\u6765\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4f53\u7531\u591a\u9879\u4eba\u53e3\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7279\u5f81\u5b9a\u4e49\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u5e8f\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2a\u4f53\u81ea\u8bc4\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u6821\u6b63\u5065\u5eb7\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5168\u56fd\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u8f83\u597d\u62df\u5408\u7231\u5c14\u51702022\u5e74\u5b9e\u9645\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u60c5\u666f\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6761\u4ef6\u6709\u6240\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u53e3\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u56fd\u5e73\u5747\u81ea\u8bc4\u5065\u5eb7\u6c34\u5e73\u8f7b\u5fae\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u5730\u7406\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5065\u5eb7\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5730\u65b9\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u9884\u5224\u672c\u5730\u5065\u5eb7\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4e3a\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for intelligent power grid drawing review, driven by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through advanced prompt engineering. Mimicking the human expert review process, the first stage leverages an MLLM for global semantic understanding to intelligently propose domain-specific semantic regions from a low-resolution overview. The second stage then performs high-resolution, fine-grained recognition within these proposed regions, acquiring detailed information with associated confidence scores. In the final stage, a comprehensive decision-making module integrates these confidence-aware results to accurately diagnose design errors and provide a reliability assessment. Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings demonstrate our approach significantly enhances MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, showing improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference.

Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement.

This requirement imposes strict constraints on the design of any ontology intended to function as a shared substrate. We establish an impossibility result for ontological neutrality: neutrality, understood as interpretive non-commitment and stability under incompatible extensions, is incompatible with the inclusion of causal or normative commitments at the foundational layer. Any ontology that asserts causal or deontic conclusions as ontological facts cannot serve as a neutral substrate across divergent frameworks without revision or contradiction. It follows that neutral ontological substrates must be pre-causal and pre-normative, representing entities, together with identity and persistence conditions, while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation.

To address this, we introduce CityCube, a systematic benchmark designed to probe cross-view reasoning capabilities of current VLMs in urban settings. CityCube integrates four viewpoint dynamics to mimic camera movements and spans a wide spectrum of perspectives from multiple platforms, e.g., vehicles, drones and satellites. For a comprehensive assessment, it features 5,022 meticulously annotated multi-view QA pairs categorized into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions. A comprehensive evaluation of 33 VLMs reveals a significant performance disparity with humans: even large-scale models struggle to exceed 54.1% accuracy, remaining 34.2% below human performance. By contrast, small-scale fine-tuned VLMs achieve over 60.0% accuracy, highlighting the necessity of our benchmark.

Yet their belief-forming behavior is governed by implicit, uninspected epistemic policies. This paper argues for an epistemic constitution for AI: explicit, contestable meta-norms that regulate how systems form and express beliefs. Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5efa\u7acb\u201c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5baa\u6cd5\u201d\uff0c\u5373\u4e00\u5957\u660e\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u4e89\u8bae\u7684\u5143\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u4ee5\u89c4\u8303\u5176\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6765\u6e90\u5f52\u56e0\u504f\u89c1\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u7531\u4e3b\u4e49\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u4e8e\u67cf\u62c9\u56fe\u5f0f\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8868\u8fbe\u65f6\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u672a\u7ecf\u5ba1\u89c6\u7684\u9690\u6027\u8ba4\u77e5\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u4e0e\u53ef\u95ee\u8d23\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5e26\u6709\u6765\u6e90\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8bba\u8bc1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u8eab\u4efd-\u7acb\u573a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5c06\u6765\u6e90\u654f\u611f\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u9700\u6291\u5236\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u975e\u5408\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u6bd4\u8f83\u67cf\u62c9\u56fe\u5f0f\u4e0e\u81ea\u7531\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e24\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u5baa\u6cd5\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f1a\u5173\u95ed\u6765\u6e90\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6765\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5408\u7406\u8fd0\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u81ea\u7531\u4e3b\u4e49\u8def\u5f84\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u4f53\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8b66\u89c9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u91c7\u7eb3\u81ea\u7531\u4e3b\u4e49\u8ba4\u77e5\u5baa\u6cd5\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u5305\u542b\u516b\u9879\u539f\u5219\u4e0e\u56db\u9879\u53d6\u5411\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7fAI\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6cbb\u7406\u5177\u5907\u4e0eAI\u4f26\u7406\u540c\u7b49\u7684\u660e\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u3002"}}

Low-quality labels may hamper performance and make the model training less robust. To address this issue, we propose SegAE (Segmentation Assessment Engine), a lightweight vision-language model (VLM) that automatically predicts label quality across 142 anatomical structures. Trained on over four million image-label pairs with quality scores, SegAE achieves a high correlation coefficient of 0.902 with ground-truth Dice similarity and evaluates a 3D mask in 0.06s. SegAE shows several practical benefits: (I) Our analysis reveals widespread low-quality labeling across public datasets; (II) SegAE improves data efficiency and training performance in active and semi-supervised learning, reducing dataset annotation cost by one-third and quality-checking time by 70% per label.

Conventional safeguards often rely on a binary paradigm that strictly distinguishes between benign and attack agents, failing to account for infected agents i.e., benign entities converted by attack agents. In this paper, we propose Infection-Aware Guard, INFA-Guard, a novel defense framework that explicitly identifies and addresses infected agents as a distinct threat category. By leveraging infection-aware detection and topological constraints, INFA-Guard accurately localizes attack sources and infected ranges. During remediation, INFA-Guard replaces attackers and rehabilitates infected ones, avoiding malicious propagation while preserving topological integrity.

We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale. These findings highlight that modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size, and that structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual mathematical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u5f31\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u201d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVisTIRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u548cOCR\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347VLM\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dVLM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u56fe\u50cf\u5f62\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8bfb\u53d6\u5bc6\u96c6\u516c\u5f0f\u3001\u7248\u9762\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u56fe\u6587\u6df7\u5408\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVisTIRA\uff08Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u9010\u6b65\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eLaTeX\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u8bed\u6599\uff08\u5982NuminaMath\uff09\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4f5c\u4e1a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6SnapAsk\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03VLM\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u76d1\u7763\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347VLM\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1bOCR\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bf9\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u660e\u663e\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u51cf\u5f31\uff1b\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eOCR\u5b9a\u4f4d\u662f\u4e92\u8865\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f29\u5c0f\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u8d8a\u5927\uff0c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u8d8a\u5c0f\u3002"}}

Submitted to a conference implementing a double-blind review process", "summary": "Recent work shows that fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve high valid plan rates on PDDL planning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this reflects transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization. In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting.

While existing frameworks characterize agents through demographic attributes, personality traits, and interests, they lack mechanisms to encode behavioral dispositions toward platform actions, causing agents to exhibit homogeneous engagement patterns rather than the differentiated participation styles observed on real platforms. In this paper, we investigate the role of behavioral traits as an explicit characterization layer to regulate agents' propensities across posting, re-sharing, commenting, reacting, and inactivity. Through large-scale simulations involving 980 agents and validation against real-world social media data, we demonstrate that behavioral traits are essential to sustain heterogeneous, profile-consistent participation patterns and enable realistic content propagation dynamics through the interplay of amplification- and interaction-oriented profiles.

This paper has been accepted by the Pacific Rim International Conference Series on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI) 2025 but not published yet. This is the submission to review version, not the camera-ready version", "summary": "The dynamic multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem is a challenging scheduling problem that requires making decisions on both the execution order of activities and their corresponding execution modes. Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs. Then, a group selection rule selects the best activity combination. We develop a multi-tree GP framework to evolve both types of rules simultaneously.

Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA. Together, MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enable better training and understanding of MAS in the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMAS-Orchestra\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MAS\uff09\u7684\u7f16\u6392\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u7528\u5f0f\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165MASBENCH\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30MAS\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1MAS\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u65b9\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u9010\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9MAS\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08SAS\uff09\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "MAS-Orchestra\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u5b50\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u53ef\u8c03\u7528\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u751f\u6210\u6574\u4e2aMAS\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efaMASBENCH\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ece\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u3001\u5e7f\u5ea6\u3001\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u523b\u753b\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eMAS\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u534f\u8bae\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f16\u6392\u5668\u4e0e\u5b50\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1bMAS-Orchestra\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "MAS-Orchestra\u4e0eMASBENCH\u5171\u540c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

A theory with growing evidence is that people simulate using simplified representations of the environment that abstract away from irrelevant details, but it is unclear how people determine these simplifications efficiently. Here, we present a \"Just-in-Time\" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions. We find strong empirical support for this account over alternative models in a grid-world planning task and a physical reasoning task across a range of behavioral measures.

Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware. We evaluate PhyloEvolve on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods.

However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction.

ICAI'25: 27th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence https://american-cse.org/csce2025/conferences-ICAI", "summary": "Qualitative research often contains personal, contextual, and organizational details that pose privacy risks if not handled appropriately. Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff08SFAA\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u533f\u540d\u5316\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePhi\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u53d1\u73b091%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ec6\u8282\u82e5\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5f53\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u52a8\u533f\u540d\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6613\u626d\u66f2\u539f\u610f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSFAA\u4e09\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u533f\u540d\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56db\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u66ff\u6362\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u5199\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u3001\u6291\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528LLaMA\u548cPhi\u4e24\u4e2a\u672c\u5730LLM\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0882\u6b21\u9762\u5bf9\u9762\u8bbf\u8c08\u548c93\u6b21AI\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8bbf\u8c08\uff09\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "LLM\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u9605\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u591a\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\uff1bPhi\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u51fa\u7387\uff08>91%\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0894.8%\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u867d\u7565\u591a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u5730LLM\u7684SFAA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u8bed\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7b26\u5408GDPR\u3001HIPAA\u7b49\u56fd\u9645\u4f26\u7406\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Submitted to ACL ARR 2026 January", "summary": "Autonomous driving is a highly challenging domain that requires reliable perception and safe decision-making in complex scenarios. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation.

Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC. Moreover, we observe that enhanced captions with LFS leads to improved performance on video question answering. Overall, LFS provides an effective and easy-to-integrate solution for detailed video captioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff08LFS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b57\u5e55\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ICH-CC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u6240\u6709\u5e27\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u63cf\u8ff0\u8d28\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLearnable Frame Selector (LFS)\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u95f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u5e27\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u89c6\u9891-LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b57\u5e55\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6ICH-CC\u3002", "result": "LFS\u5728VDC\u548cICH-CC\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe2.0%\u548c4%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "LFS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks.

Yet, visual language models (VLMs) lack an analogous mechanism for spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to generate images that accurately reflect geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent. We introduce the concept of a spatial scratchpad -- a 3D reasoning substrate that bridges linguistic intent and image synthesis. Given a text prompt, our framework parses subjects and background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, and employs agentic scene planning for placement, orientation, and viewpoint selection. The resulting 3D arrangement is rendered back into the image domain with identity-preserving cues, enabling the VLM to generate spatially consistent and visually coherent outputs. Unlike prior 2D layout-based methods, our approach supports intuitive 3D edits that propagate reliably into final images. Empirically, it achieves a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, demonstrating the benefit of explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation. Our results highlight a new paradigm for vision-language models that deliberate not only in language, but also in space.

Existing deep learning models struggle to jointly learn from such diverse data, often sacrificing either generalization or domain-specific knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint training method called Universal Harmonization (U-Harmony), which can be integrated into deep learning-based architectures with a domain-gated head, enabling a single segmentation model to learn from heterogeneous datasets simultaneously. By integrating U-Harmony, our approach sequentially normalizes and then denormalizes feature distributions to mitigate domain-specific variations while preserving original dataset-specific knowledge. More appealingly, our framework also supports universal modality adaptation, allowing the seamless learning of new imaging modalities and anatomical classes.

Most existing unsupervised summarization methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance keyframe selection and generate coherent, video summaries through adversarial training. However, such approaches primarily exploit unimodal features, overlooking the guiding role of semantic information in keyframe selection, and often suffer from unstable training. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method. Specifically, we design a novel frame-level semantic alignment attention mechanism and integrate it into a keyframe selector, which guides the Transformer-based generator within the adversarial framework to better reconstruct videos.

This leads to common errors where VLMs misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying the most specific level (leaf level). Existing approaches largely overlook this issue by failing to model hierarchical reasoning. To address this gap, we propose VL-Taxon, a two-stage, hierarchy-based reasoning framework designed to improve both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency in taxonomic classification. The first stage employs a top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy. The second stage then leverages this accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage is initially trained with supervised fine-tuning to instill taxonomy knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning to refine the model's reasoning and generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal a remarkable result: our VL-Taxon framework, implemented on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, outperforms its original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on the iNaturalist-2021 dataset.

Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Cir\u00e9 and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering. Through experiments on a sequencing problem with time windows and a just-in-time objective ($1 \\mid r_j, d_j, \\bar{d}_j \\mid \\sum E_j + \\sum T_j$), we observe that the proposed filtering, even with a threshold on the width, achieves a stronger reduction in the number of nodes visited in the search tree compared to the previously proposed precedence-detection algorithm of Cir\u00e9 and van Hoeve.

Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images.

To address this limitation, extensive research has focused on enhancing model grounding capabilities through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning. However, rather than compelling agents to adapt to human-centric interfaces, we propose constructing interaction interfaces specifically optimized for agents. This paper introduces Component Interface for Agent (CI4A), a semantic encapsulation mechanism that abstracts the complex interaction logic of UI components into a set of unified tool primitives accessible to agents. We implemented CI4A within Ant Design, an industrial-grade front-end framework, covering 23 categories of commonly used UI components. Furthermore, we developed a hybrid agent featuring an action space that dynamically updates according to the page state, enabling flexible invocation of available CI4A tools. Leveraging the CI4A-integrated Ant Design, we refactored and upgraded the WebArena benchmark to evaluate existing SoTA methods.

Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \\emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise.

This strict causality supervision optimizes each step only by its immediate next token, which diminishes global coherence and slows convergence. We ask whether foresight, training signals that originate from later tokens, can help AR visual generation. We conduct a series of controlled diagnostics along the injection level, foresight layout, and foresight source axes, unveiling a key insight: aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on the 2D image grids improves causality modeling. We formulate this insight with Mirai (meaning \"future\" in Japanese), a general framework that injects future information into AR training with no architecture change and no extra inference overhead: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, whereas Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Extensive experiments show that Mirai significantly accelerates convergence and improves generation quality. For instance, Mirai can speed up LlamaGen-B's convergence by up to 10$\\times$ and reduce the generation FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on the ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark.

Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.\n  We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison. Given these four desiderata, we outline a structured approach to evaluating and comparing awareness profiles across artificial systems with differing architectures, scales, and operational domains. By shifting the focus from artificial consciousness to being just aware enough, this approach aims to facilitate principled assessment, support design and oversight, and enable more constructive scientific and public discourse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u201c\u89c9\u77e5\u201d\uff08awareness\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u201c\u610f\u8bc6\u201d\uff08consciousness\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u9053\u5fb7\u5730\u4f4d\u4e0e\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u66f4\u53ef\u884c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ee1\u8db3\u9886\u57df\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u201c\u89c9\u77e5\u201d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5177\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u56db\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u9886\u57df\u654f\u611f\u3001\u4efb\u610f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u3001\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u6bd4\u8f83\uff09\u6765\u523b\u753b\u4e0d\u540cAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89c9\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6bd4\u8f83\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u89c9\u77e5\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u76d1\u7ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7126\u70b9\u4ece\u201c\u4eba\u5de5\u610f\u8bc6\u201d\u8f6c\u5411\u201c\u8db3\u591f\u89c9\u77e5\u201d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u5efa\u8bbe\u6027\u7684\u516c\u5171\u4e0e\u5b66\u672f\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002"}}

The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for un- derstanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi- behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional trans- formers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behav- ior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while sig- nificantly reducing computational cost.

This position is affected by unexamined onto-epistemological assumptions: meaning is treated as immanent to the model, the explainer is positioned outside the system, and a causal structure is presumed recoverable through computational techniques. In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods.

Beyond obvious failures, the subtle issue of \"intent deviation\" severely hinders reliable evaluation and performance improvement. Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning. We introduce RISE, a \"Real-to-Virtual\" method designed to mitigate intent deviation. Anchoring on verified tool primitives, RISE synthesizes virtual trajectories and generates diverse negative samples through mutation on critical parameters. With synthetic data, RISE fine-tunes backbone LLMs via the two-stage training for intent alignment. Evaluation results demonstrate that data synthesized by RISE achieve promising results in eight metrics covering user requires, execution trajectories and agent responses. Integrating with training, RISE achieves an average 35.28% improvement in Acctask (task completion) and 23.27% in Accintent (intent alignment), outperforming SOTA baselines by 1.20--42.09% and 1.17--54.93% respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRISE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u771f\u5b9e\u5230\u865a\u62df\u201d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u610f\u56fe\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u201c\u610f\u56fe\u504f\u79fb\u201d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u771f\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6837\u672c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u865a\u62df\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u610f\u56fe\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "RISE\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u539f\u8bed\u4e3a\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u865a\u62df\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u53d8\u5f02\u6765\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6db5\u76d6\u7528\u6237\u8bf7\u6c42\u3001\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u516b\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\uff0cRISE\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\uff08Acctask\uff09\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u7387\uff08Accintent\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e8635.28%\u548c23.27%\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "RISE\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u201c\u771f\u5b9e\u5230\u865a\u62df\u201d\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing methods mainly enhance inter-class distinctions and employ data augmentation to mitigate semantic ambiguity and reduce spurious activations. However, they often neglect the complex contextual dependencies among image patches, resulting in incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Context Patch Fusion with Class Token Enhancement (CPF-CTE) framework, which exploits contextual relations among patches to enrich feature representations and improve segmentation. At its core, the Contextual-Fusion Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CF-BiLSTM) module captures spatial dependencies between patches and enables bidirectional information flow, yielding a more comprehensive understanding of spatial correlations. This strengthens feature learning and segmentation robustness. Moreover, we introduce learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics, enhancing discriminative capability. By effectively integrating spatial and semantic cues, CPF-CTE produces richer and more accurate representations of image content. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 validate that CPF-CTE consistently surpasses prior WSSS methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCPF-CTE\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u878d\u5408\u53cc\u5411LSTM\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7c7b\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728PASCAL VOC 2012\u548cMS COCO 2014\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u4e4b\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c40\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5206\u5272\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCPF-CTE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u878d\u5408\u53cc\u5411LSTM\uff08CF-BiLSTM\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u83b7\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b2\uff09\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u8bb0\uff08class tokens\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u878d\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728PASCAL VOC 2012\u548cMS COCO 2014\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CPF-CTE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u7c7b\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0cCPF-CTE\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Most molecular language models rely on strings or graphs, while vision-language models often miss stereochemical details and struggle to map continuous 3D structures into discrete tokens. We propose DeepMoLM: Deep Molecular Language M odeling, a dual-view framework that grounds high-resolution molecular images in geometric invariants derived from molecular conformations. DeepMoLM preserves high-frequency evidence from 1024 $\\times$ 1024 inputs, encodes conformer neighborhoods as discrete Extended 3-Dimensional Fingerprints, and fuses visual and geometric streams with cross-attention, enabling physically grounded generation without atom coordinates. DeepMoLM improves PubChem captioning with a 12.3% relative METEOR gain over the strongest generalist baseline while staying competitive with specialist methods.

Existing proactive defenses, often adapted from image editing attacks, prove ineffective in this context. We attribute this failure to an oversight of the structural resilience and the unique static conditional guidance mechanism inherent in face swapping systems. To address this, we propose VoidFace, a systemic defense method that views face swapping as a coupled identity pathway. By injecting perturbations at critical bottlenecks, VoidFace induces cascading disruption throughout the pipeline. Specifically, we first introduce localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, thereby impairing the accurate modeling of the source face. We then intervene in the generative domain by decoupling attention mechanisms to sever identity injection, and corrupting intermediate diffusion features to prevent the reconstruction of source identity. To ensure visual imperceptibility, we perform adversarial search in the latent manifold, guided by a perceptual adaptive strategy to balance attack potency with image quality. Extensive experiments show that VoidFace outperforms existing defenses across various diffusion-based swapping models, while producing adversarial faces with superior visual quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVoidFace\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u6ce8\u5165\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u8eab\u4efd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6362\u8138\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "VoidFace\u5c06\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u89c6\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u8282\u70b9\u6ce8\u5165\u6270\u52a8\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e72\u6270\u4e0e\u8eab\u4efd\u64e6\u9664\u524a\u5f31\u6e90\u4eba\u8138\u7684\u7269\u7406\u56de\u5f52\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u57df\u89e3\u8026\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u963b\u65ad\u8eab\u4efd\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u6c61\u67d3\u4e2d\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u963b\u6b62\u8eab\u4efd\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u8861\u653b\u51fb\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVoidFace\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6362\u8138\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "VoidFace\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u6709\u6548\u7834\u574f\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u9690\u853d\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a \"compositional bridge\", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests.

Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image. Experiments show that our system reduces service latency by 33% compared with baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u8fb9\u534f\u540c\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8d85\u5206\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e33%\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237QoE\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d85\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7aef\u8fb9\u534f\u540c\u751f\u6210-\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8fb9\u7f18\u7aef\u9996\u5148\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u6570\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u5c3a\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u5757\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8d85\u5206\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u2014\u524d\u666f\u5757\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u80cc\u666f\u5757\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u62fc\u63a5\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8633%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8d85\u5206\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387T2I\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4e3aAIGC\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \\mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\u03c0(a \\mid v, \\ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBayesianVLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u70b9\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff08PMI\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u201c\u4fe1\u606f\u574d\u7f29\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u53ef\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6d88\u5931\uff08\u5373\u201c\u4fe1\u606f\u574d\u7f29\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9075\u5faa\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728OOD\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBayesianVLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684Latent Action Queries\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u522b\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03 $p(a \\mid v)$ \u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565 $\u03c0(a \\mid v, \\ell)$\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u70b9\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff08PMI\uff09\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u89c6\u89c9\u6377\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728SimplerEnv\u548cRoboCasa\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBayesianVLA\u5728\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684OOD SimplerEnv\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e8611.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5173\u8054\uff0cBayesianVLA\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u574d\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5728OOD\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike existing synthetic drone datasets, SimD3 explicitly models drones with heterogeneous payloads, incorporates multiple bird species as realistic distractors, and leverages diverse Unreal Engine 5 environments with controlled weather, lighting, and flight trajectories captured using a 360 six-camera rig. Using SimD3, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation within the YOLOv5 detection framework, including an attention-enhanced variant termed Yolov5m+C3b, where standard bottleneck-based C3 blocks are replaced with C3b modules. Models are evaluated on synthetic data, combined synthetic and real data, and multiple unseen real-world benchmarks to assess robustness and generalization.

While medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, their learned representations remain underexplored, and standard evaluations like classification accuracy do not fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis. This study aims to investigate the feature distributions learned by medical VLMs and evaluate the impact of medical specialization. We analyze the feature distribution of multiple image modalities extracted by some representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. These distributions were compared them with non-medical VLMs to assess the domain-specific medical training. Our experiments showed that medical VLMs can extract discriminative features that are effective for medical classification tasks. Moreover, it was found that non-medical VLMs with recent improvement with contextual enrichment such as LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Our results imply that enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Notably, non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases introduced by overlaied text strings on images. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration on model selection according to downstream tasks besides potential risks in inference due to background biases such as textual information in images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u6240\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u533b\u5b66VLM\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u975e\u533b\u5b66VLM\uff08\u5982LLM2CLIP\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u4e5f\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6bd4\u4ec5\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8b66\u60d5\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66VLM\u88ab\u671f\u671b\u6355\u6349\u8bca\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5b66\u5230\u75c5\u7076\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u63ed\u793a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u591a\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u533b\u5b66VLM\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u75c5\u7076\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u975e\u533b\u5b66VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u533b\u5b66VLM\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u8fd1\u671f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u975e\u533b\u5b66VLM\uff08\u5982LLM2CLIP\uff09\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u975e\u533b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u53e0\u52a0\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u5c24\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u53d1\u533b\u5b66VLM\u65f6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6bd4\u4ec5\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8c28\u614e\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u5e76\u6ce8\u610f\u56fe\u50cf\u80cc\u666f\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data. Experiments across monologue, narration, dialogue, and multi-speaker scenes show that our dubbing model consistently outperforms SOTA methods in audio quality, lip sync, timbre transfer, and instruction following.

However, current motion diffusion models face two major limitations: a representational gap caused by pre-trained text encoders that lack motion-specific information, and error propagation during the iterative denoising process. This paper introduces Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to address these challenges. First, RAM leverages a motion latent space as intermediate supervision for text-to-motion generation. To this end, RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with two key objective functions: self-regularization to enhance the discrimination of the motion space and motion-centric latent alignment to enable accurate mapping from text to the motion latent space. Second, we propose Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG), a testing-stage guidance mechanism that exploits the diffusion model's inherent self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation. At each denoising step, REG uses the motion reconstruction branch to reconstruct the previous estimate, reproducing the prior error patterns. By amplifying the residual between the current prediction and the reconstructed estimate, REG highlights the improvements in the current prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAM achieves significant improvements and state-of-the-art performance.

This study investigates whether synthetic images generated through Stable Diffusion with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can effectively augment limited real datasets for multi-task CNN-based porcelain classification. Using MobileNetV3 with transfer learning, we conducted controlled experiments comparing models trained on pure real data against those trained on mixed real-synthetic datasets (95:5 and 90:10 ratios) across four classification tasks: dynasty, glaze, kiln and type identification. Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures.

For homogeneous CD, precise boundary delineation relies on fine-grained spatial cues and local pixel interactions, whereas heterogeneous CD instead requires broader contextual information to suppress speckle noise and geometric distortions. Moreover, difference operator (e.g., subtraction) works well for aligned homogeneous images but introduces artifacts in cross-modal or geometrically misaligned scenarios. Across different modality settings, specialized models based on static backbones or fixed difference operations often prove insufficient. To address this challenge, we propose UniRoute, a unified framework for modality-adaptive learning by reformulating feature extraction and fusion as conditional routing problems. We introduce an Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) module to disentangle local spatial details from global semantic context, and a Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) module to adaptively select the most suitable fusion primitive at each pixel. In addition, we propose a Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that stabilizes unified training under data-scarce heterogeneous settings by enforcing multi-level consistency.

Historically, various handcrafted geometry-aware descriptors and feature refinement techniques have been proposed. Recently, several studies have initiated a new research direction by leveraging features from image foundation models to create semantics-aware descriptors, demonstrating advantages across tasks like shape matching, editing, and segmentation. Symmetry, another key concept in shape analysis, has also attracted increasing attention. Consequently, constructing symmetry-aware shape descriptors is a natural progression. Although the recent method $\u03c7$ (Wang et al., 2025) successfully extracted symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors, its features are only one-dimensional, neglecting other valuable semantic information. Furthermore, the extracted symmetry-informative feature is usually noisy and yields small misclassified patches. To address these gaps, we propose a feature disentanglement approach which is simultaneously symmetry informative and symmetry agnostic. Further, we propose a feature refinement technique to improve the robustness of predicted symmetry informative features.

To remedy this downside, we propose POTR, a post-training 3DGS codec built on two novel techniques. First, POTR introduces a novel pruning approach that uses a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's individual removal effect simultaneously. This technique results in 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques and as a result also significantly accelerates inference with experiments demonstrating 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models. Second, we propose a novel method to recompute lighting coefficients, significantly reducing their entropy without using any form of training. Our fast and highly parallel approach especially increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity, with experiments demonstrating increases from 70% to 97%, with minimal loss in quality. Finally, we extend POTR with a simple fine-tuning scheme to further enhance pruning, inference, and rate-distortion performance. Experiments demonstrate that POTR, even without fine-tuning, consistently outperforms all other post-training compression techniques in both rate-distortion performance and inference speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPOTR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf93D Gaussian Splatting\uff083DGS\uff09\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u526a\u679d\u548c\u5149\u7167\u7cfb\u6570\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "3DGS\u867d\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eNeRF\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "POTR\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u9879\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb3DGS\u5149\u6805\u5316\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2asplat\u7684\u79fb\u9664\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11splat\u6570\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5149\u7167\u7cfb\u6570\u91cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AC\u7cfb\u6570\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u7b80\u5355\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPOTR\u5728\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6240\u6709\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u526a\u679d\u540esplat\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c112-4\u500d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.5-2\u500d\uff0cAC\u7cfb\u6570\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4ece70%\u63d0\u5347\u81f397%\u3002", "conclusion": "POTR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u76843DGS\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863DGS\u9ad8\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f63D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u6e32\u67d3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars.

This design enables interpretable reasoning over spatial relations (e.g., distance, direction, visibility) and supports downstream tasks such as language-guided navigation and object retrieval without specialized sensors.

Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories. Towards larger-scale studies, we also examine automated evaluation methods, comparing several established approaches against human judgments.

To overcome this, we propose a holistic, video-centric paradigm named \\textbf{L}ocal \\textbf{D}iffusion \\textbf{F}orcing for \\textbf{V}ideo \\textbf{F}rame \\textbf{I}nterpolation (LDF-VFI). Our framework is built upon an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models the entire video sequence to ensure long-range temporal coherence. To mitigate error accumulation inherent in auto-regressive generation, we introduce a novel skip-concatenate sampling strategy that effectively maintains temporal stability. Furthermore, LDF-VFI incorporates sparse, local attention and tiled VAE encoding, a combination that not only enables efficient processing of long sequences but also allows generalization to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining. An enhanced conditional VAE decoder, which leverages multi-scale features from the input video, further improves reconstruction fidelity. Empirically, LDF-VFI achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

Existing TBPS methods therefore rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning to handle distribution shift, resulting in multiple independently trained models for different datasets. While synthetic data can increase the scale needed to fine-tune VLMs, it does not eliminate dataset-specific adaptation. This motivates a fundamental question: can we train a single unified TBPS model across multiple datasets? We show that naive joint training over all datasets remains sub-optimal because current training paradigms do not scale to a large number of unique person identities and are vulnerable to noisy image-text pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Scale-TBPS with two contributions: (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets; and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective under a large number of unique identities. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, IIITD-20K, and UFine6926 demonstrate that a single Scale-TBPS model outperforms dataset-centric optimized models and naive joint training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faScale-TBPS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u5224\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u884c\u4eba\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u884c\u4eba\u68c0\u7d22\uff08TBPS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9700\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6269\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6d88\u9664\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u5426\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7edf\u4e00TBPS\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faScale-TBPS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a(i) \u4e00\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6574\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u591a\u4e2aTBPS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b(ii) \u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u8eab\u4efd\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u552f\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728CUHK-PEDES\u3001ICFG-PEDES\u3001RSTPReid\u3001IIITD-20K\u548cUFine6926\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u4e00Scale-TBPS\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u6734\u7d20\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8eab\u4efd\u5b66\u4e60\uff0cScale-TBPS\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6587\u672c\u884c\u4eba\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528TBPS\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints. Finally, we benchmark state-of-the-art models across 10 datasets, spanning everyday scenes to medical imaging.

It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams.

However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations. Collectively, this synergistic ecosystem of evaluation and data establishes a robust foundation for rigorous assessment and scalable training of video models, accelerating the evolution of embodied AI toward general intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RBench\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u548cRoVid-X\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u884c\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6RBench\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7b49\u5b50\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u542b400\u4e07\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u9891\u7247\u6bb5\u7684RoVid-X\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5bf925\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1bRBench\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684Spearman\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u8fbe0.96\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RBench\u4e0eRoVid-X\u5171\u540c\u6784\u6210\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u534f\u540c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u5177\u8eabAI\u5411\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

While prior DL methods have demonstrated varying levels of success, they often suffer from instability, limited fidelity, or poor robustness under realistic FL settings. We introduce a new DL attack that integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process. By guiding optimization toward the distribution of realistic images (represented by a flow matching foundation model), our method enhances reconstruction fidelity without requiring knowledge of the private data. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and target models demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics. Crucially, the method remains effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses such as noise injection, clipping, and sparsification.

However, existing approaches still suffer from several limitations. For background regions obtained from decomposition, existing methods adopt a uniform suppression strategy for all patches, overlooking the varying contributions of different patches to the prediction. For foreground regions, existing methods fail to adequately consider that some local patches may exhibit appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, which may mislead the training process. To address these issues, we propose a new plug-and-play framework. This framework consists of three core components: (1) a Foreground-Background Decomposition module, which follows previous FG-BG methods to separate an image into foreground and background regions; (2) an Adaptive Background Suppression module, which adaptively weights patch classification entropy; and (3) a Confusable Foreground Rectification module, which identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play framework significantly improves the performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods.

A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization--composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects. Extensive experiments show that PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, highlighting the benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPictorialCortex\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u4e2a\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecefMRI\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u91cd\u5efa\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5fMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6UniCortex-fMRI\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u548c\u8bd5\u9a8c\u95f4\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4ecefMRI\u4fe1\u53f7\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5355\u5c04\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u88ab\u8bd5\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u4e2a\u4f53\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5fMRI-to-image\u91cd\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u73b0\u5b9e\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u591a\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u76ae\u5c42\u8868\u9762fMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6UniCortex-fMRI\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faPictorialCortex\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u523a\u6fc0\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5c06\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bd5\u9a8c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5730\u7eb3\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u76ae\u5c42\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3-\u7ec4\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u914d\u5bf9\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u91cd\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5df2\u89c1\u88ab\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5408\u6210\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u672a\u89c1\u88ab\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPictorialCortex\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u6f5c\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3fMRI-to-image\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u521b\u8111\u673a\u63a5\u53e3\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u89e3\u7801\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Existing training-based hateful video detection methods are constrained by limited training data and lack of interpretability, while directly prompting large vision-language models often struggle to deliver reliable hate detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MARS, a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework that enables reliable and interpretable hateful content detection. MARS begins with the objective description of video content, establishing a neutral foundation for subsequent analysis. Building on this, it develops evidence-based reasoning that supports potential hateful interpretations, while in parallel incorporating counter-evidence reasoning to capture plausible non-hateful perspectives. Finally, these perspectives are synthesized into a conclusive and explainable decision. Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. In addition, MARS produces human-understandable justifications, thereby supporting compliance oversight and enhancing the transparency of content moderation workflows.

Traditional bibliometric tools rely mainly on metadata and offer limited visibility into the semantic content of papers, making it hard to track how research themes evolve over time or how different areas influence one another. To obtain a clearer picture of recent developments, we compile a unified corpus of more than 100,000 papers from 22 major conferences between 2020 and 2025 and construct a multidimensional profiling pipeline to organize and analyze their textual content. By combining topic clustering, LLM-assisted parsing, and structured retrieval, we derive a comprehensive representation of research activity that supports the study of topic lifecycles, methodological transitions, dataset and model usage patterns, and institutional research directions. Our analysis highlights several notable shifts, including the growth of safety, multimodal reasoning, and agent-oriented studies, as well as the gradual stabilization of areas such as neural machine translation and graph-based methods.

Experimental findings show that CNN architectures consistently achieved strong performance, with ResNet50 attaining 98.83% accuracy. Transformer models demonstrated competitive generalization capabilities, with ViT achieving the highest accuracy among them at 95.38%. However, individual Transformer variants exhibited greater class-specific instability. The proposed Evan_V2 hybrid model, which integrates outputs from ten CNN and Transformer architectures through feature-level fusion, achieved the best overall performance with 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, and 0.9968 ROC AUC.

Existing methods relying solely on 3D diffusion models tend to suffer a degradation in appearance details, while those utilizing only 2D diffusion models typically compromise camera controllability. To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts.

While modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at describing what is visible, it remains unclear whether they can infer how far a task has progressed from partial observations.

Experiments on 14 VLMs show that most models are not yet ready for task progress estimation, exhibiting sensitivity to demonstration modality and viewpoint changes, as well as poor handling of unanswerable cases. While training-free prompting that enforces structured progress reasoning yields limited and model-dependent gains, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at a small model scale, despite being trained on a task set fully disjoint from the evaluation tasks.

While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems.

For code and dataset, see https://github.com/cvims/DrivIng", "summary": "Perception is a cornerstone of autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to understand their surroundings and make safe, reliable decisions. Developing robust perception algorithms requires large-scale, high-quality datasets that cover diverse driving conditions and support thorough evaluation. Existing datasets often lack a high-fidelity digital twin, limiting systematic testing, edge-case simulation, sensor modification, and sim-to-real evaluations. To address this gap, we present DrivIng, a large-scale multimodal dataset with a complete geo-referenced digital twin of a ~18 km route spanning urban, suburban, and highway segments. Our dataset provides continuous recordings from six RGB cameras, one LiDAR, and high-precision ADMA-based localization, captured across day, dusk, and night.

We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D).

Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \\textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \\eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faStableWorld\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5e27\u5254\u9664\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStableWorld\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u5e27\u5254\u9664\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9000\u5316\u5e27\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e27\uff0c\u4ece\u6e90\u5934\u9632\u6b62\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "result": "\u5728Matrix-Game\u3001Open-Oasis\u548cHunyuan-GameCraft\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86StableWorld\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "StableWorld\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u957f\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0e\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Our method leverages a generative image-based light decomposition model that factorizes complex indoor scene illumination into its constituent light sources. This factorization enables independent manipulation of individual light sources, specifically allowing control over their state (on/off), chromaticity, and intensity. We further introduce multi-view lighting harmonization to ensure consistent propagation of the lighting decomposition across all scene views. This is integrated into a relightable 3D Gaussian splatting representation, providing real-time interactive control over the individual light sources.

We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions. EgoWM improves SCS by up to 80 percent over prior state-of-the-art navigation world models, while achieving up to six times lower inference latency and robust generalization to unseen environments, including navigation inside paintings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEgocentric World Model\uff08EgoWM\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5408\u7406\u672a\u6765\u753b\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u80fd\u5fe0\u5b9e\u54cd\u5e94\u52a8\u4f5c\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "EgoWM\u5728\u4e0d\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6761\u4ef6\u5c42\u6ce8\u5165\u52a8\u4f5c\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u5ea6\u6216\u63a7\u5236\u6307\u4ee4\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "EgoWM\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u672a\u6765\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u5728Structural Consistency Score\uff08SCS\uff09\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe80%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u516d\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u753b\u4f5c\u5185\u90e8\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "EgoWM\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation. Through an elaborate attribute-preserving design for teacher learning, APPLE produces high-quality pseudo triplets that explicitly provide the student with direct face-swapping supervision. Overall, APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing more photorealistic and target-faithful results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAPPLE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8eab\u4efd\u8fc1\u79fb\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u5149\u7167\u3001\u80a4\u8272\u3001\u5986\u5bb9\uff09\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u7ed3\u679c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u8fc1\u79fb\u6e90\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u7559\u76ee\u6807\u4eba\u8138\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u5916\u89c2\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u5c5e\u6027\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAPPLE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6848\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u8bbe\u8ba1\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "APPLE\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u5177\u7167\u7247\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e14\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u4eba\u8138\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u5efa\u6a21\uff0cAPPLE\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4eba\u8138\u4ea4\u6362\u4e2d\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}
