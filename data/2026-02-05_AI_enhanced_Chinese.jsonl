Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation. Our findings suggest that TMK functions not merely as context, but also as a mechanism that steers reasoning models away from their default linguistic modes to engage formal, code-execution pathways in the context of the experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6559\u80b2\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1-\u65b9\u6cd5-\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08TMK\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728PlanBench\u7684Blocksworld\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cTMK\u63d0\u793a\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece31.5%\u63d0\u5347\u81f397.3%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982CoT\uff09\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u771f\u6b63\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u5230\u8d28\u7591\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u501f\u9274\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684TMK\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06TMK\u6846\u67b6\u878d\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u3001\u76ee\u7684\u8bba\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5728PlanBench\u57fa\u51c6\u7684Blocksworld\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u968f\u673a\u7248\u672c\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u91c7\u7528TMK\u63d0\u793a\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u539f\u672c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7b26\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\uff08Random Blocksworld\uff09\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ece31.5%\u589e\u81f397.3%\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u53cd\u8f6c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "TMK\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u66f4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u9ed8\u8ba4\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5411\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5f25\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002"}}

Although recent advances in multi-agent LLM-based systems have enhanced their mathematical reasoning capabilities, they still lack a reliably revisable representation of the reasoning process. Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus.

This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of a single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development.

However, current progress remains fragmented, lacking a unified view of the underlying mechanisms, protection paradigms, and robustness challenges. To address this gap, we present the first systematic survey on 3DGS IP protection and introduce a bottom-up framework that examines (i) underlying Gaussian-based perturbation mechanisms, (ii) passive and active protection paradigms, and (iii) robustness threats under emerging generative AI era, revealing gaps in technical foundations and robustness characterization and indicating opportunities for deeper investigation. Finally, we outline six research directions across robustness, efficiency, and protection paradigms, offering a roadmap toward reliable and trustworthy IP protection for 3DGS assets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf93D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u5e95\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u516d\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77403DGS\u5728\u5b9e\u65f63D\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5546\u4e1a\u4ef7\u503c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5176\u663e\u5f0f\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u65b0\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5e95\u5c42\u9ad8\u65af\u6270\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u3001\u88ab\u52a8\u4e0e\u4e3b\u52a8\u4fdd\u62a4\u8303\u5f0f\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5a01\u80c1\u4e09\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d3DGS\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u5728\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u591a\u4e2a\u503c\u5f97\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a3DGS\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u8303\u5f0f\u7b49\u516d\u5927\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, the mechanisms governing the effectiveness of MAS built upon publicly available LLMs, specifically the underlying rationales for their success or failure, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we revisit MAS through the perspective of uncertainty, considering both intra- and inter-agent dynamics by investigating entropy transitions during problem-solving across various topologies and six benchmark tasks. By analyzing 245 features spanning token-, trajectory-, and round-level entropy, we counterintuitively find that a single agent outperforms MAS in approximately 43.3% of cases, and that uncertainty dynamics are largely determined during the first round of interaction. Furthermore, we provide three key observations: 1) Certainty Preference: reducing uncertainty at any stage for any agent is critical for guaranteeing correct solutions; 2) Base Uncertainty: base models with lower entropy during problem-solving directly benefit MAS performance; and 3) Task Awareness: entropy dynamics of MAS play varying roles across different tasks. Building on these insights, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, the Entropy Judger, to select solutions from MAS's pass@k results, leading to consistent accuracy improvements across all MAS configurations and tasks.

We propose a state-level selective verification framework that combines (i) deterministic feasibility gating over a structured move interface, (ii) pre-verification ranking using a hybrid of learned state-distance and residual scoring, and (iii) adaptive allocation of verifier calls based on local uncertainty.

Recent work has reported that monitorability--the degree to which CoT faithfully and informatively reflects internal computation--can appear as a \"free gift\" during the early stages of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We make this observation concrete through a systematic evaluation across model families and training domains. Our results show that this effect is not universal: monitorability improvements are strongly data-dependent. In particular, we demonstrate the critical role of data diversity and instruction-following data during RLVR training. We further show that monitorability is orthogonal to capability--improvements in reasoning performance do not imply increased transparency. Through mechanistic analysis, we attribute monitorability gains primarily to response distribution sharpening (entropy reduction) and increased attention to the prompt, rather than stronger causal reliance on reasoning traces. We also reveal how monitorability dynamics vary with controlled training and evaluation difficulty. Together, these findings provide a holistic view of how monitorability emerges under RLVR, clarifying when gains are likely to occur and when they are not.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RLVR\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\uff08monitorability\uff09\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u6b63\u4ea4\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u8ba1\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5728RLVR\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u201c\u514d\u8d39\u201d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u5bf9RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u6210\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u5ea6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u71b5\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u6210\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6570\u636e\uff1b2\uff09\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6b63\u4ea4\uff1b3\uff09\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u9510\u5316\uff08\u71b5\u964d\u4f4e\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u5728RLVR\u4e2d\u5e76\u975e\u81ea\u52a8\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u5176\u51fa\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u4f1a\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u900f\u660e\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Yet modern AI systems increasingly operate within human decision loops, where users interpret and act on model recommendations. Large Language Models generate fluent natural-language explanations that shape how users perceive and trust AI outputs, revealing a new attack surface at the cognitive layer: the communication channel between AI and its users. We introduce adversarial explanation attacks (AEAs), where an attacker manipulates the framing of LLM-generated explanations to modulate human trust in incorrect outputs. We formalize this behavioral threat through the trust miscalibration gap, a metric that captures the difference in human trust between correct and incorrect outputs under adversarial explanations. By incorporating this gap, AEAs explore the daunting threats in which persuasive explanations reinforce users' trust in incorrect predictions. To characterize this threat, we conducted a controlled experiment (n = 205), systematically varying four dimensions of explanation framing: reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, and presentation format. Our findings show that users report nearly identical trust for adversarial and benign explanations, with adversarial explanations preserving the vast majority of benign trust despite being incorrect. The most vulnerable cases arise when AEAs closely resemble expert communication, combining authoritative evidence, neutral tone, and domain-appropriate reasoning. Vulnerability is highest on hard tasks, in fact-driven domains, and among participants who are less formally educated, younger, or highly trusting of AI.

Counterfactuals have emerged as one of the most compelling forms of explanation. They address ``why not'' questions by revealing how decisions could be altered. Despite the growing literature, most existing explainers focus on a single type of counterfactual and are restricted to local explanations, focusing on individual instances. There has been no systematic study of alternative counterfactual types, nor of global counterfactuals that shed light on a system's overall reasoning process.\n  This paper addresses the two gaps by introducing an axiomatic framework built on a set of desirable properties for counterfactual explainers. It proves impossibility theorems showing that no single explainer can satisfy certain axiom combinations simultaneously, and fully characterizes all compatible sets. Representation theorems then establish five one-to-one correspondences between specific subsets of axioms and the families of explainers that satisfy them.

Recent advances in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to embodied agents have addressed many long-standing challenges, such as high-level goal decomposition and online adaptation. Yet, uncertainty is still primarily mitigated through frequent inter-agent communication. This incurs substantial token and time costs, and can disrupt established workflows, when human partners are involved. We introduce PCE, a Planner-Composer-Evaluator framework that converts the fragmented assumptions latent in LLM reasoning traces into a structured decision tree. Internal nodes encode environment assumptions and leaves map to actions; each path is then scored by scenario likelihood, goal-directed gain, and execution cost to guide rational action selection without heavy communication. Across two challenging multi-agent benchmarks (C-WAH and TDW-MAT) and three diverse LLM backbones, PCE consistently outperforms communication-centric baselines in success rate and task efficiency while showing comparable token usage. Ablation results indicate that the performance gains obtained by scaling model capacity or reasoning depth persist even when PCE is applied, while PCE consistently raises the baseline across both capacity and reasoning-depth scales, confirming that structured uncertainty handling complements both forms of scaling. A user study further demonstrates that PCE produces communication patterns that human partners perceive as more efficient and trustworthy. Together, these results establish a principled route for turning latent LLM assumptions into reliable strategies for uncertainty-aware planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPCE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u542b\u5047\u8bbe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u3001\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f9d\u8d56\u9891\u7e41\u901a\u4fe1\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8token\u6d88\u8017\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u5e72\u6270\u4eba\u7c7b\u534f\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u9ad8\u9891\u901a\u4fe1\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPlanner-Composer-Evaluator\uff08PCE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u788e\u7247\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u8282\u70b9\u8868\u793a\u73af\u5883\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\u5e94\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b\u6bcf\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u6839\u636e\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6536\u76ca\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u7406\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5728C-WAH\u548cTDW-MAT\u4e24\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0cPCE\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14token\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePCE\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u4e3aPCE\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6a21\u5f0f\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u3002", "conclusion": "PCE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06LLM\u9690\u542b\u5047\u8bbe\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u534f\u540c\u589e\u6548\u3002"}}

However, many real-world decision-making tasks are inherently online: crucial information must be acquired through interaction, feedback is delayed, and effective behavior requires balancing information collection and exploitation over time. While in-context learning enables adaptation without weight updates, existing LLMs often struggle to reliably leverage in-context interaction experience in such settings. In this work, we show that this limitation can be addressed through training. We introduce ORBIT, a multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to learn from interaction in context. After meta-training, a relatively small open-source model (Qwen3-14B) demonstrates substantially improved in-context online learning on entirely unseen environments, matching the performance of GPT-5.2 and outperforming standard RL fine-tuning by a large margin.

However, existing methods primarily focus on static objects, while understanding dynamic point cloud sequences remains largely unexplored. This limitation is mainly caused by the lack of large-scale cross-modal datasets and the difficulty of modeling motions in spatio-temporal contexts. To bridge this gap, we present 4DPC$^2$hat, the first MLLM tailored for dynamic point cloud understanding. To this end, we construct a large-scale cross-modal dataset 4DPC$^2$hat-200K via a meticulous two-stage pipeline consisting of topology-consistent 4D point construction and two-level captioning. The dataset contains over 44K dynamic object sequences, 700K point cloud frames, and 200K curated question-answer (QA) pairs, supporting inquiries about counting, temporal relationship, action, spatial relationship, and appearance. At the core of the framework, we introduce a Mamba-enhanced temporal reasoning MLLM to capture long-range dependencies and dynamic patterns among a point cloud sequence. Furthermore, we propose a failure-aware bootstrapping learning strategy that iteratively identifies model deficiencies and generates targeted QA supervision to continuously strengthen corresponding reasoning capabilities.

However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B.

Beyond generating segmentation masks, providing rich and interpretable diagnoses of mask quality remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce Mask Quality Assessment in the Ref-AVS context (MQA-RefAVS), a new task that evaluates the quality of candidate segmentation masks without relying on ground-truth annotations as references at inference time. Given audio-visual-language inputs and each provided segmentation mask, the task requires estimating its IoU with the unobserved ground truth, identifying the corresponding error type, and recommending an actionable quality-control decision. To support this task, we construct MQ-RAVSBench, a benchmark featuring diverse and representative mask error modes that span both geometric and semantic issues. We further propose MQ-Auditor, a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based auditor that explicitly reasons over multimodal cues and mask information to produce quantitative and qualitative mask quality assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MQ-Auditor outperforms strong open-source and commercial MLLMs and can be integrated with existing Ref-AVS systems to detect segmentation failures and support downstream segmentation improvement.

In this work, we proposed an ultrafast IR method for 3D PACT, called Gaussian-kernel-based Ultrafast 3D Photoacoustic Iterative Reconstruction (GPAIR), which achieves orders-of-magnitude acceleration in computing. GPAIR transforms traditional spatial grids with continuous isotropic Gaussian kernels. By deriving analytical closed-form expression for pressure waves and implementing powerful GPU-accelerated differentiable Triton operators, GPAIR demonstrates extraordinary ultrafast sub-second reconstruction speed for 3D targets containing 8.4 million voxels in animal experiments.

While models excel at execution, users often struggle to guide them effectively due to insufficient domain expertise, the difficulty of articulating precise intent, and the inability to reliably validate complex outputs. It presents a critical challenge in scalable oversight: enabling humans to responsibly steer AI systems on tasks that surpass their own ability to specify or verify. To tackle this, we propose Scalable Interactive Oversight, a framework that decomposes complex intent into a recursive tree of manageable decisions to amplify human supervision. Rather than relying on open-ended prompting, our system elicits low-burden feedback at each node and recursively aggregates these signals into precise global guidance. Validated in web development task, our framework enables non-experts to produce expert-level Product Requirement Documents, achieving a 54\\% improvement in alignment. Crucially, we demonstrate that this framework can be optimized via Reinforcement Learning using only online user feedback, offering a practical pathway for maintaining human control as AI scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u201d\uff08Scalable Interactive Oversight\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\uff0c\u4f7f\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6210\u8d85\u8d8a\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u5f00\u53d1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ea7\u51fa\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6267\u884c\u5982\u201c\u6c1b\u56f4\u7f16\u7801\u201d\u7b49\u957f\u5468\u671f\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u65ad\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u9762\u4e34\u201c\u76d1\u7763\u9e3f\u6c9f\u201d\uff1a\u7528\u6237\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u610f\u56fe\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u9a8c\u8bc1\u590d\u6742\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u76d1\u7763\u201d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u610f\u56fe\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6613\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8282\u70b9\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u6536\u96c6\u4f4e\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e76\u9012\u5f52\u805a\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u7cbe\u51c6\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fd8\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u5f00\u53d1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u9700\u6c42\u6587\u6863\uff08PRD\uff09\u8fbe\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8654%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u80fd\u529b\u4e0eAI\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728AI\u80fd\u529b\u6301\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This study investigates whether state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models can reduce thousands of unlabeled animal images directly to species-level clusters. We present a comprehensive benchmarking framework evaluating five ViT models combined with five dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms, two supervised and two unsupervised, across 60 species (30 mammals and 30 birds), with each test using a random subset of 200 validated images per species. We investigate when clustering succeeds at species-level, where it fails, and whether clustering within the species-level reveals ecologically meaningful patterns such as sex, age, or phenotypic variation. Our results demonstrate near-perfect species-level clustering (V-measure: 0.958) using DINOv3 embeddings with t-SNE and supervised hierarchical clustering methods. Unsupervised approaches achieve competitive performance (0.943) while requiring no prior species knowledge, rejecting only 1.14% of images as outliers requiring expert review. We further demonstrate robustness to realistic long-tailed distributions of species and show that intentional over-clustering can reliably extract intra-specific variation including age classes, sexual dimorphism, and pelage differences.

However, most existing work relies on large-scale demonstrations from technical professionals and close monitoring of the training process. These are challenging for a layperson when they want to teach the agent new skills. To lower the barrier of teaching AI agents, we propose Interactive Policy Restructuring and Training (InterPReT), which takes user instructions to continually update the policy structure and optimize its parameters to fit user demonstrations. This enables end-users to interactively give instructions and demonstrations, monitor the agent's performance, and review the agent's decision-making strategies. A user study (N=34) on teaching an AI agent to drive in a racing game confirms that our approach yields more robust policies without impairing system usability, compared to a generic imitation learning baseline, when a layperson is responsible for both giving demonstrations and determining when to stop.

While numerous bias mitigation methods have been proposed, comparing the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods remains difficult due to heterogeneous datasets, inconsistent fairness metrics, isolated evaluation of vision versus multi-modal models, and insufficient hyperparameter tuning that undermines fair comparisons. We introduce NH-Fair, a unified benchmark for fairness without harm that spans both vision models and large vision-language models (LVLMs) under standardized data, metrics, and training protocols, covering supervised and zero-shot regimes. Our key contributions are: (1) a systematic ERM tuning study that identifies training choices with large influence on both utility and disparities, yielding empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners reduce expensive hyperparameter tuning space in achieving strong fairness and accuracy; (2) evidence that many debiasing methods do not reliably outperform a well-tuned ERM baseline, whereas a composite data-augmentation method consistently delivers parity gains without sacrificing utility, emerging as a promising practical strategy. (3) an analysis showing that while LVLMs achieve higher average accuracy, they still exhibit subgroup disparities, and gains from scaling are typically smaller than those from architectural or training-protocol choices.

However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns. To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods.

These have become foundational for image and video generation and, more recently, physical simulation. As existing tokenizers are designed for the explicit requirements of realistic visual perception of images, it is necessary to ask whether these approaches are optimal for scientific images, which exhibit a large dynamic range and require token embeddings to retain physical and spectral properties. In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a suite of image tokenizers across a range of metrics designed to measure the fidelity of PDE properties in both physical and spectral space. Based on the observation that these struggle to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes, we propose Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition. We demonstrate that Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across a range of PDE datasets.

Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth & Occlusion, Orientation, Size & Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans.

A fundamental question remains: are all transformer blocks equally important for downstream performance? In this paper, we show that block importance in masked self-supervised vision transformers can be accurately estimated without access to any data. Our key finding is that the information entropy of pretrained block weights strongly correlates with oracle sensitivity obtained via iterative block removal and finetuning. This observation enables Gardener, a data-free, one-shot, block-level pruning principle that identifies redundant blocks through simple information-theoretic measurements. We evaluate Gardener on VideoMAE-B across multiple pruning ratios and downstream video recognition benchmarks. Despite its negligible computational overhead, Gardener consistently matches or outperforms existing data-free pruning baselines and closely approaches sensitivity-based pruning. Remarkably, even after pruning up to 91.7\\% of blocks, the pruned model retains competitive transfer performance. Our results reveal substantial block-level redundancy in masked self-supervised vision transformers and demonstrate that information-theoretic analysis offers a principled and efficient pathway for model compression and resource-efficient transfer learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGardener\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u7684\u5757\u7ea7\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1Masked\u81ea\u76d1\u7763Vision Transformer\u4e2d\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u5e45\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6700\u591a\u526a\u966491.7%\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Masked\u81ea\u76d1\u7763Vision Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5197\u4f59\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u6240\u6709Transformer\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u540c\u7b49\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGardener\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u5757\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u79fb\u9664+\u5fae\u8c03\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u3001\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5757\u7ea7\u526a\u679d\u3002", "result": "\u5728VideoMAE-B\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cGardener\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u526a\u679d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u57fa\u4e8e\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u7684\u526a\u679d\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u526a\u966491.7%\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Masked\u81ea\u76d1\u7763Vision Transformer\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5757\u7ea7\u5197\u4f59\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u7684\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u526a\u679d\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u8282\u7ea6\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Addressing this paradox, we propose a framework of sequential interaction, in which a GenAI system proposes questions to a forum that can publish some of them. Our framework captures several intricacies of such a collaboration, including non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment. We bring the framework to life through comprehensive, data-driven simulations using real Stack Exchange data and commonly used LLMs. We demonstrate the incentive misalignment empirically, yet show that players can achieve roughly half of the utility in an ideal full-information scenario. Our results highlight the potential for sustainable collaboration that preserves effective knowledge sharing between AI systems and human knowledge platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u4ea4\u4e92\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u95ee\u7b54\u8bba\u575b\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea6\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e73\u53f0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u7b54\u8bba\u575b\u6570\u636e\u5374\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6d41\u5176\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e8c\u8005\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u975e\u8d27\u5e01\u4ea4\u6362\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u548c\u6fc0\u52b1\u9519\u4f4d\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4ea4\u4e92\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9eStack Exchange\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u4eff\u771f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6fc0\u52b1\u9519\u4f4d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u8868\u660e\u5728\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u7406\u60f3\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u7ea650%\u7684\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e73\u53f0\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6709\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u534f\u4f5c\u3002"}}

Despite significant leaps in visual fidelity, this approach has encountered a ``usability ceiling'' manifested as the Intent-Execution Gap (i.e., the fundamental disparity between a creator's high-level intent and the stochastic, black-box nature of current single-shot models). In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the \\textbf{Vibe AIGC}, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows.\n  Under this paradigm, the user's role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta-Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this ``Vibe'' into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution.

While recent approaches have demonstrated pose-free reconstruction from unposed image collections, integrating stylization or appearance control into such pipelines remains underexplored. Existing attempts largely rely on image-based conditioning, which limits both controllability and flexibility. In this work, we introduce AnyStyle, a feed-forward 3D reconstruction and stylization framework that enables pose-free, zero-shot stylization through multimodal conditioning. Our method supports both textual and visual style inputs, allowing users to control the scene appearance using natural language descriptions or reference images. We propose a modular stylization architecture that requires only minimal architectural modifications and can be integrated into existing feed-forward 3D reconstruction backbones. Experiments demonstrate that AnyStyle improves style controllability over prior feed-forward stylization methods while preserving high-quality geometric reconstruction. A user study further confirms that AnyStyle achieves superior stylization quality compared to an existing state-of-the-art approach.

Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed design methodology is able to outperform non-parameterized design approaches, and it can be easily extended to other types of DL applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7efc\u5408\uff08HLS\uff09\u7684\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eFPGA\u4e0a\u7684CNN\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u529f\u8017\u3001\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709FPGA\u4e0a\u7684CNN\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982GOPS\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u529f\u8017\u3001\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u591a\u91cd\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u786c\u4ef6-\u8f6f\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7efc\u5408\uff08HLS\uff09\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9CNN\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u8fd8\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Reported studies demonstrate competence on various tasks ranging from EHR analysis and differential diagnosis to treatment planning and research workflows. Yet the literature largely consists of overviews which are either broad surveys or narrow dives into a single capability (e.g., memory, planning, reasoning), leaving healthcare work without a common frame. We address this by reviewing 49 studies using a seven-dimensional taxonomy: Cognitive Capabilities, Knowledge Management, Interaction Patterns, Adaptation & Learning, Safety & Ethics, Framework Typology and Core Tasks & Subtasks with 29 operational sub-dimensions. Using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria and a labeling rubric (Fully Implemented, Partially Implemented, Not Implemented), we map each study to the taxonomy and report quantitative summaries of capability prevalence and co-occurrence patterns. Our empirical analysis surfaces clear asymmetries. For instance, the External Knowledge Integration sub-dimension under Knowledge Management is commonly realized (~76% Fully Implemented) whereas Event-Triggered Activation sub-dimenison under Interaction Patterns is largely absent (~92% Not Implemented) and Drift Detection & Mitigation sub-dimension under Adaptation & Learning is rare (~98% Not Implemented). Architecturally, Multi-Agent Design sub-dimension under Framework Typology is the dominant pattern (~82% Fully Implemented) while orchestration layers remain mostly partial. Across Core Tasks & Subtasks, information centric capabilities lead e.g., Medical Question Answering & Decision Support and Benchmarking & Simulation, while action and discovery oriented areas such as Treatment Planning & Prescription still show substantial gaps (~59% Not Implemented).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e03\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e8649\u9879\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u533b\u7597\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u591a\u4e3a\u5bbd\u6cdb\u7efc\u8ff0\u6216\u805a\u7126\u5355\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57dfLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e03\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b49\uff09\u548c29\u4e2a\u5b50\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u636e\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7eb3\u5165/\u6392\u9664\u6807\u51c6\u53ca\u4e09\u6863\u6807\u7b7e\uff08\u5b8c\u5168\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\u5bf949\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff1a\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u666e\u904d\uff0876%\u5b8c\u5168\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0892%\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\u548c\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7f13\u89e3\uff0898%\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\u5219\u6781\u4e3a\u7f55\u89c1\uff1b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u4e3b\u6d41\uff0882%\u5b8c\u5168\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\uff1b\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u800c\u884c\u52a8\u5bfc\u5411\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6cbb\u7597\u89c4\u5212\uff0c59%\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u540c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u533b\u7597LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u91cd\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing WSI-level assessments -- using annotated landmarks or intensity-based similarity metrics -- are often time-consuming, unreliable, and computationally intensive, limiting large-scale applicability. This study proposes a fast, unsupervised framework that jointly employs down-sampled tissue masks- and deformations-based metrics for registration quality assessment (RQA) of registered H&E and IHC WSI pairs. The masks-based metrics measure global structural correspondence, while the deformations-based metrics evaluate local smoothness, continuity, and transformation realism. Validation across multiple IHC markers and multi-expert assessments demonstrate a strong correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations.

A Competing Hypothesis", "comment": null, "summary": "Rapidly increasing AI capabilities have substantial real-world consequences, ranging from AI safety concerns to labor market consequences. The Model Evaluation & Threat Research (METR) report argues that AI capabilities have exhibited exponential growth since 2019. In this note, we argue that the data does not support exponential growth, even in shorter-term horizons. Whereas the METR study claims that fitting sigmoid/logistic curves results in inflection points far in the future, we fit a sigmoid curve to their current data and find that the inflection point has already passed.

We introduce Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a new paradigm for open-ended self-improvements, which treats a group of agents as the fundamental evolutionary unit, enabling explicit experience sharing and reuse within the group throughout evolution. Unlike existing open-ended self-evolving paradigms that adopt tree-structured evolution, GEA overcomes the limitation of inefficient utilization of exploratory diversity caused by isolated evolutionary branches. We evaluate GEA on challenging coding benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified, 88.3% vs. 68.3% on Polyglot) and matches or exceeds top human-designed agent frameworks (71.8% and 52.0% on two benchmarks, respectively). Analysis reveals that GEA more effectively converts early-stage exploratory diversity into sustained, long-term progress, achieving stronger performance under the same number of evolved agents. Furthermore, GEA exhibits consistent transferability across different coding models and greater robustness, fixing framework-level bugs in 1.4 iterations on average, versus 5 for self-evolving methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGroup-Evolving Agents\uff08GEA\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e3a\u8fdb\u5316\u5355\u5143\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u5404\u8fdb\u5316\u5206\u652f\u76f8\u4e92\u5b64\u7acb\uff1b\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5171\u4eab\u4e0e\u590d\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u672c\u8fdb\u5316\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8fdb\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u6811\u72b6\u8fdb\u5316\u4e2d\u5206\u652f\u9694\u79bb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728SWE-bench Verified\u548cPolyglot\u7b49\u4ee3\u7801\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGEA\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523071.0%\u548c88.3%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0856.7%\u300168.3%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u9876\u5c16\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u4fee\u590d\u6846\u67b6\u7ea7\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u5e73\u57471.4\u6b21 vs 5\u6b21\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "GEA\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u4f53\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u65e9\u671f\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Prior approaches rely on intermediate tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation, which often underperform in complex scenes, particularly in the presence of occlusion and clutter. We address this by introducing an iterative object removal and reconstruction pipeline that decomposes complex scenes into a sequence of simpler subtasks. Using VLMs as orchestrators, foreground objects are removed one at a time via detection, segmentation, object removal, and 3D fitting. We show that removing objects allows for cleaner segmentations of subsequent objects, even in highly occluded scenes. Our method requires no task-specific training and benefits directly from ongoing advances in foundation models. We demonstrate stateof-the-art robustness on 3D-Front and ADE20K datasets.

However, the internal model mechanisms that allow this superior performance remain poorly understood. We present a mechanistic analysis of how QwQ-32B - a model specifically trained to produce extensive reasoning traces - process abstract structural information. On Mystery Blocksworld - a semantically obfuscated planning domain - we find that QwQ-32B gradually improves its internal representation of actions and concepts during reasoning. The model develops abstract encodings that focus on structure rather than specific action names. Through steering experiments, we establish causal evidence that these adaptations improve problem solving: injecting refined representations from successful traces boosts accuracy, while symbolic representations can replace many obfuscated encodings with minimal performance loss.

While AI models for H\\&E-stained slides show promise, their applicability to IHC is limited due to domain-specific variations. Here we introduce HPA10M, a dataset that contains 10,495,672 IHC images from the Human Protein Atlas with comprehensive metadata included, and encompasses 45 normal tissue types and 20 major cancer types. Based on HPA10M, we trained iSight, a multi-task learning framework for automated IHC staining assessment. iSight combines visual features from whole-slide images with tissue metadata through a token-level attention mechanism, simultaneously predicting staining intensity, location, quantity, tissue type, and malignancy status. On held-out data, iSight achieved 85.5\\% accuracy for location, 76.6\\% for intensity, and 75.7\\% for quantity, outperforming fine-tuned foundation models (PLIP, CONCH) by 2.5--10.2\\%. In addition, iSight demonstrates well-calibrated predictions with expected calibration errors of 0.0150-0.0408. Furthermore, in a user study with eight pathologists evaluating 200 images from two datasets, iSight outperformed initial pathologist assessments on the held-out HPA dataset (79\\% vs 68\\% for location, 70\\% vs 57\\% for intensity, 68\\% vs 52\\% for quantity). Inter-pathologist agreement also improved after AI assistance in both held-out HPA (Cohen's $\u03ba$ increased from 0.63 to 0.70) and Stanford TMAD datasets (from 0.74 to 0.76), suggesting expert--AI co-assessment can improve IHC interpretation.

Existing approaches either sample frames uniformly (risking information loss) or select keyframes in a single pass (with no recovery from poor choices). We propose VideoBrain, an end-to-end framework that enables VLMs to adaptively acquire visual information through learned sampling policies. Our approach features dual complementary agents: a CLIP-based agent for semantic retrieval across the video and a Uniform agent for dense temporal sampling within intervals. Unlike prior agent-based methods that rely on text-only LLMs orchestrating visual tools, our VLM directly perceives frames and reasons about information sufficiency. To prevent models from invoking agents indiscriminately to maximize rewards, we introduce a behavior-aware reward function coupled with a data classification pipeline that teaches the model when agent invocation is genuinely beneficial.

Existing deep learning methods either fail to capture long-range spectral dependencies (e.g., convolutional neural networks) or suffer from high computational cost (e.g., Transformers). To address these challenges, we propose DMS2F-HAD, a novel dual-branch Mamba-based model. Our architecture utilizes Mamba's linear-time modeling to efficiently learn distinct spatial and spectral features in specialized branches, which are then integrated by a dynamic gated fusion mechanism to enhance anomaly localization. Across fourteen benchmark HSI datasets, our proposed DMS2F-HAD not only achieves a state-of-the-art average AUC of 98.78%, but also demonstrates superior efficiency with an inference speed 4.6 times faster than comparable deep learning methods.

Extensive experimentation on real endoscopy recordings studies our approach's most suitable configuration and evaluates SuperPoint-E feature quality. The comparison with other baselines also shows that our 3D reconstructions are denser and cover more and longer video segments because our detector fires more densely and our features are more likely to survive (i.e. higher detection precision).

Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models.

Existing approaches face two major challenges: mask-based insertion methods require labor-intensive mask annotations, while instruction-based methods struggle to place objects at precise locations. Point2Insert addresses these issues by requiring only a small number of sparse points instead of dense masks, eliminating the need for tedious mask drawing. Specifically, it supports both positive and negative points to indicate regions that are suitable or unsuitable for insertion, enabling fine-grained spatial control over object locations. The training of Point2Insert consists of two stages. In Stage 1, we train an insertion model that generates objects in given regions conditioned on either sparse-point prompts or a binary mask. In Stage 2, we further train the model on paired videos synthesized by an object removal model, adapting it to video insertion. Moreover, motivated by the higher insertion success rate of mask-guided editing, we leverage a mask-guided insertion model as a teacher to distill reliable insertion behavior into the point-guided model.

However, existing methods typically suffer from (i) the computational redundancy of dense voxel representations, (ii) structural redundancy inherent in multi-branch architectures, and (iii) the under-utilization of spectral information in capturing global motion patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient EAR framework named HoloEv-Net. First, to simultaneously tackle representation and structural redundancies, we introduce a Compact Holographic Spatiotemporal Representation (CHSR). Departing from computationally expensive voxel grids, CHSR implicitly embeds horizontal spatial cues into the Time-Height (T-H) view, effectively preserving 3D spatiotemporal contexts within a 2D representation. Second, to exploit the neglected spectral cues, we design a Global Spectral Gating (GSG) module. By leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for global token mixing in the frequency domain, GSG enhances the representation capability with negligible parameter overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our framework. Specifically, HoloEv-Net-Base achieves state-of-the-art performance on THU-EACT-50-CHL, HARDVS and DailyDVS-200, outperforming existing methods by 10.29%, 1.71% and 6.25%, respectively.

However, most prior instruction-following planners rely on simulation or fixed command vocabularies, limiting real-world generalization. doScenes, the first real-world dataset linking free-form instructions (with referentiality) to nuScenes ground-truth motion, enables instruction-conditioned planning. In this work, we adapt OpenEMMA, an open-source MLLM-based end-to-end driving framework that ingests front-camera views and ego-state and outputs 10-step speed-curvature trajectories, to this setting, presenting a reproducible instruction-conditioned baseline on doScenes and investigate the effects of human instruction prompts on predicted driving behavior. We integrate doScenes directives as passenger-style prompts within OpenEMMA's vision-language interface, enabling linguistic conditioning before trajectory generation. Evaluated on 849 annotated scenes using ADE, we observe that instruction conditioning substantially improves robustness by preventing extreme baseline failures, yielding a 98.7% reduction in mean ADE. When such outliers are removed, instructions still influence trajectory alignment, with well-phrased prompts improving ADE by up to 5.1%.

This decoding paradigm naturally enables a quality-latency trade-off at inference via the number of refinement steps.We further improve motion token fidelity with residual vector quantization (RVQ) and enhance alignment and controllability with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show strong motion quality and competitive bidirectional understanding under a unified framework.

Recent efforts to address this issue have involved the painstaking compilation of real low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) image pairs, usually limited to several specific downscaling factors. To address these challenges, our work introduces a novel framework capable of synthesizing authentic LR images from a single HR image by leveraging the latent degradation space with flow matching. Our approach generates LR images with realistic artifacts at unseen degradation levels, which facilitates the creation of large-scale, real-world SR training datasets. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments verify that our synthetic LR images accurately replicate real-world degradations. Furthermore, both traditional and arbitrary-scale SR models trained using our datasets consistently yield much better HR outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u5177\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u9000\u5316\u6548\u679c\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u9000\u5316\uff08\u5982\u53cc\u4e09\u6b21\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5305\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u4f2a\u5f71\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9000\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u771f\u5b9eLR-HR\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u7684\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u9000\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4ece\u5355\u5f20HR\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u5177\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684LR\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u9000\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cSR\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u5408\u6210\u7684LR\u56fe\u50cf\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u5c3a\u5ea6SR\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u9000\u5316\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u9000\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike the leading vision-language systems that tokenize videos through a naive frame-sampling strategy, we propose to decouple the spatial and temporal representations of videos by retaining the spatial features of a single key frame while encoding each subsequent frame into a single residual token, achieving compact yet expressive video tokenization. Our experiments suggest that VTok effectively reduces the complexity of video representation from the product of frame count and per-frame token count to their sum, while the residual tokens sufficiently capture viewpoint and motion changes relative to the key frame. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of VTok: it achieves notably higher performance on a range of video understanding and text-to-video generation benchmarks compared with baselines using naive tokenization, all with shorter token sequences per video (e.g., 3.4% higher accuracy on our TV-Align benchmark and 1.9% higher VBench score). Remarkably, VTok produces more coherent motion and stronger guidance following in text-to-video generation, owing to its more consistent temporal encoding. We hope VTok can serve as a standardized video tokenization paradigm for future research in video understanding and generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "VTok \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u540e\u7eed\u5e27\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6b8b\u5dee\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9010\u5e27\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "VTok \u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u89e3\u8026\uff1a\u4fdd\u7559\u5355\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5176\u4f59\u5e27\u4ec5\u4ee5\u5355\u4e2a\u6b8b\u5dee\u6807\u8bb0\u8868\u793a\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u793a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u201c\u5e27\u6570 \u00d7 \u6bcf\u5e27\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u201d\u964d\u4f4e\u4e3a\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u548c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cVTok \u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u6734\u7d20\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728 TV-Align \u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347 3.4%\uff0cVBench \u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347 1.9%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "VTok \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Guided by this insight, we propose AGMA (Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Anchors), which constructs expressive priors through two stages: extracting diverse behavioral patterns from training data and distilling them into a scene-adaptive global prior for inference.

Bhattacharya and Debanjan Goswami contributed equally to this work", "summary": "Continual learning (or class incremental learning) is a realistic learning scenario for computer vision systems, where deep neural networks are trained on episodic data, and the data from previous episodes are generally inaccessible to the model. Existing research in this domain has primarily focused on avoiding catastrophic forgetting, which occurs due to the continuously changing class distributions in each episode and the inaccessibility of the data from previous episodes. However, these methods assume that all the training samples in every episode are annotated; this not only incurs a huge annotation cost, but also results in a wastage of annotation effort, since most of the samples in a given episode will not be accessible to the model in subsequent episodes. Active learning algorithms identify the salient and informative samples from large amounts of unlabeled data and are instrumental in reducing the human annotation effort in inducing a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose ACIL, a novel active learning framework for class incremental learning settings. We exploit a criterion based on uncertainty and diversity to identify the exemplar samples that need to be annotated in each episode, and will be appended to the data in the next episode. Such a framework can drastically reduce annotation cost and can also avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our extensive empirical analyses on several vision datasets corroborate the promise and potential of our framework against relevant baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faACIL\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u51c6\u5219\u9009\u62e9\u6bcf\u8f6e\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6bcf\u8f6e\u6240\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u90fd\u5df2\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\uff1b\u800c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ece\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6311\u9009\u5173\u952e\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faACIL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u7559\u81f3\u540e\u7eed\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cACIL\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ACIL\u4e3a\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing video autoencoders suffer from three major limitations: (1) fixed-rate compression that wastes tokens on simple videos, (2) inflexible CNN architectures that prevent variable-length latent modeling, and (3) deterministic decoders that struggle to recover appropriate details from compressed latents. To address these issues, we propose One-Dimensional Diffusion Video Autoencoder (One-DVA), a transformer-based framework for adaptive 1D encoding and diffusion-based decoding. The encoder employs query-based vision transformers to extract spatiotemporal features and produce latent representations, while a variable-length dropout mechanism dynamically adjusts the latent length. The decoder is a pixel-space diffusion transformer that reconstructs videos with the latents as input conditions. With a two-stage training strategy, One-DVA achieves performance comparable to 3D-CNN VAEs on reconstruction metrics at identical compression ratios. More importantly, it supports adaptive compression and thus can achieve higher compression ratios.

Project page: https://wusar.github.io/projects/skeletongaussian", "summary": "4D generation has made remarkable progress in synthesizing dynamic 3D objects from input text, images, or videos. However, existing methods often represent motion as an implicit deformation field, which limits direct control and editability. To address this issue, we propose SkeletonGaussian, a novel framework for generating editable dynamic 3D Gaussians from monocular video input. Our approach introduces a hierarchical articulated representation that decomposes motion into sparse rigid motion explicitly driven by a skeleton and fine-grained non-rigid motion. Concretely, we extract a robust skeleton and drive rigid motion via linear blend skinning, followed by a hexplane-based refinement for non-rigid deformations, enhancing interpretability and editability. Experimental results demonstrate that SkeletonGaussian surpasses existing methods in generation quality while enabling intuitive motion editing, establishing a new paradigm for editable 4D generation.

Recent attention-guided enhancement (e.g., cropping or region-focused attention allocation) alleviates this, yet it commonly hinges on a static \"magic layer\" empirically chosen on simple recognition benchmarks and thus may not transfer to complex reasoning tasks. In contrast to this static assumption, we propose a dynamic perspective on visual grounding. Through a layer-wise sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that visual grounding is a dynamic process: while simple object recognition tasks rely on middle layers, complex visual search and reasoning tasks require visual information to be reactivated at deeper layers. Based on this observation, we introduce Visual Activation by Query (VAQ), a metric that identifies the layer whose attention map is most relevant to query-specific visual grounding by measuring attention sensitivity to the input query. Building on VAQ, we further propose LASER (Layer-adaptive Attention-guided Selective visual and decoding Enhancement for Reasoning), a training-free inference procedure that adaptively selects task-appropriate layers for visual localization and question answering. Experiments across diverse VQA benchmarks show that LASER significantly improves VQA accuracy across tasks with varying levels of complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLASER\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5c42\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u56fa\u5b9a\u89c6\u89c9token\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u9759\u6001\u201cmagic layer\u201d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u6613\u4e22\u5931\u7ec6\u8282\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u5c42\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faVAQ\u6307\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LASER\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u95ee\u7b54\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cLASER\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e94\u89c6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

While this shift to sparse 3D representations solves the encoding bottleneck, it creates a new challenge for the decoder: how to efficiently aggregate information from a sparse, non-uniformly distributed set of voxel features without resorting to computationally prohibitive dense attention.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel Prototype-based Sparse Transformer Decoder that replaces this costly interaction with an efficient, two-stage process of guided feature selection and focused aggregation. Our core idea is to make the decoder's attention prototype-guided. We achieve this through a sparse prototype selection mechanism, where each query adaptively identifies a compact set of the most salient voxel features, termed prototypes, for focused feature aggregation.\n  To ensure this dynamic selection is stable and effective, we introduce a complementary denoising paradigm. This approach leverages ground-truth masks to provide explicit guidance, guaranteeing a consistent query-prototype association across decoder layers. Our model, dubbed SPOT-Occ, outperforms previous methods with a significant margin in speed while also improving accuracy.

We propose Collaborative Fine-Tuning (CoFT), an unsupervised adaptation framework that leverages unlabeled data through a dual-model, cross-modal collaboration mechanism. CoFT introduces a dual-prompt learning strategy with positive and negative textual prompts to explicitly model pseudo-label cleanliness in a sample-dependent manner, removing the need for hand-crafted thresholds or noise assumptions. The negative prompt also regularizes lightweight visual adaptation modules, improving robustness under noisy supervision. CoFT employs a two-phase training scheme, transitioning from parameter-efficient fine-tuning on high-confidence samples to full fine-tuning guided by collaboratively filtered pseudo-labels. Building on CoFT, CoFT+ further enhances adaptation via iterative fine-tuning, momentum contrastive learning, and LLM-generated prompts.

While current editing approaches predominantly focus on 3D Gaussian Splatting or multi-view images, the direct editing of 3D meshes remains underexplored. Prior attempts, such as VoxHammer, rely on voxel-based representations that suffer from limited resolution and necessitate labor-intensive 3D mask. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{VecSet-Edit}, the first pipeline that leverages the high-fidelity VecSet Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) as a backbone for mesh editing. Our approach is grounded on a analysis of the spatial properties in VecSet tokens, revealing that token subsets govern distinct geometric regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Mask-guided Token Seeding and Attention-aligned Token Gating strategies to precisely localize target regions using only 2D image conditions. Also, considering the difference between VecSet diffusion process versus voxel we design a Drift-aware Token Pruning to reject geometric outliers during the denoising process. Finally, our Detail-preserving Texture Baking module ensures that we not only preserve the geometric details of original mesh but also the textural information.

Although existing MER approaches have achieved promising results, they still struggle with inherent multimodal heterogeneities and varying contributions from different modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Decoupled Hierarchical Multimodal Distillation (DHMD). DHMD decouples each modality's features into modality-irrelevant (homogeneous) and modality-exclusive (heterogeneous) components using a self-regression mechanism. The framework employs a two-stage knowledge distillation (KD) strategy: (1) coarse-grained KD via a Graph Distillation Unit (GD-Unit) in each decoupled feature space, where a dynamic graph facilitates adaptive distillation among modalities, and (2) fine-grained KD through a cross-modal dictionary matching mechanism, which aligns semantic granularities across modalities to produce more discriminative MER representations.

However, mainstream VAR paradigms attend to all tokens across historical scales at each autoregressive step. As the next scale resolution grows, the computational complexity of attention increases quartically with resolution, causing substantial latency. Prior accelerations often skip high-resolution scales, which speeds up inference but discards high-frequency details and harms image quality. To address these problems, we present SparVAR, a training-free acceleration framework that exploits three properties of VAR attention: (i) strong attention sinks, (ii) cross-scale activation similarity, and (iii) pronounced locality. Specifically, we dynamically predict the sparse attention pattern of later high-resolution scales from a sparse decision scale, and construct scale self-similar sparse attention via an efficient index-mapping mechanism, enabling high-efficiency sparse attention computation at large scales. Furthermore, we propose cross-scale local sparse attention and implement an efficient block-wise sparse kernel, which achieves $\\mathbf{> 5\\times}$ faster forward speed than FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SparseVAR can reduce the generation time of an 8B model producing $1024\\times1024$ high-resolution images to the 1s, without skipping the last scales. Compared with the VAR baseline accelerated by FlashAttention, our method achieves a $\\mathbf{1.57\\times}$ speed-up while preserving almost all high-frequency details. When combined with existing scale-skipping strategies, SparseVAR attains up to a $\\mathbf{2.28\\times}$ acceleration, while maintaining competitive visual generation quality.

Unlike pure language models, MLLMs must ground their generation process in visual inputs. However, existing models often suffer from semantic drift during decoding, causing outputs to diverge from visual facts as the sequence length increases.\n  To address this issue, we propose KVSmooth, a training-free and plug-and-play method that mitigates hallucination by performing attention-entropy-guided adaptive smoothing on hidden states. Specifically, KVSmooth applies an exponential moving average (EMA) to both keys and values in the KV-Cache, while dynamically quantifying the sink degree of each token through the entropy of its attention distribution to adaptively adjust the smoothing strength.\n  Unlike computationally expensive retraining or contrastive decoding methods, KVSmooth operates efficiently during inference without additional training or model modification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KVSmooth significantly reduces hallucination ($\\mathit{CHAIR}_{S}$ from $41.8 \\rightarrow 18.2$) while improving overall performance ($F_1$ score from $77.5 \\rightarrow 79.2$), achieving higher precision and recall simultaneously.

Yet current high-precision segmentation models rely on GPUs, making them impractical to deploy in primary hospitals, mobile endoscopy units, or capsule robots. To bridge this gap, we present the UltraSeg family, operating in an extreme-compression regime (<0.3 M parameters). UltraSeg-108K (0.108 M parameters) is optimized for single-center data, while UltraSeg-130K (0.13 M parameters) generalizes to multi-center, multi-modal images. By jointly optimizing encoder-decoder widths, incorporating constrained dilated convolutions to enlarge receptive fields, and integrating a cross-layer lightweight fusion module, the models achieve 90 FPS on a single CPU core without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluated on seven public datasets, UltraSeg retains >94% of the Dice score of a 31 M-parameter U-Net while utilizing only 0.4% of its parameters, establishing a strong, clinically viable baseline for the extreme-compression domain and offering an immediately deployable solution for resource-constrained settings.

To this end, we introduce Med-MMFL, the first comprehensive MMFL benchmark for the medical domain, encompassing diverse modalities, tasks, and federation scenarios. Our benchmark evaluates six representative state-of-the-art FL algorithms, covering different aggregation strategies, loss formulations, and regularization techniques. It spans datasets with 2 to 4 modalities, comprising a total of 10 unique medical modalities, including text, pathology images, ECG, X-ray, radiology reports, and multiple MRI sequences. Experiments are conducted across naturally federated, synthetic IID, and synthetic non-IID settings to simulate real-world heterogeneity. We assess segmentation, classification, modality alignment (retrieval), and VQA tasks.

However, large-scale mapping of these settlements is severely constrained not only by the scarcity of annotations but by inherent data quality challenges, specifically high spectral ambiguity between formal and informal structures and significant annotation noise. We address this by introducing a benchmark dataset for Lahore, constructed from scratch, along with companion datasets for Karachi and Mumbai, which were derived from verified administrative boundaries, totaling 1,869 $\\text{km}^2$ of area. To evaluate the global robustness of our framework, we extend our experiments to five additional established benchmarks, encompassing eight cities across three continents, and provide comprehensive data quality assessments of all datasets. We also propose a new semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to mitigate the class imbalance and feature degradation inherent in standard semi-supervised learning pipelines. Our method integrates a Class-Aware Adaptive Thresholding mechanism that dynamically adjusts confidence thresholds to prevent minority class suppression and a Prototype Bank System that enforces semantic consistency by anchoring predictions to historically learned high-fidelity feature representations. Extensive experiments across a total of eight cities spanning three continents demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised baselines.

Splatting (3DGS) advances demonstrate impressive rendering quality and real-time performance, they critically depend on precise camera calibration and pose annotations, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We present JOintGS, a unified framework that jointly optimizes camera extrinsics, human poses, and 3D Gaussian representations from coarse initialization through a synergistic refinement mechanism. Our key insight is that explicit foreground-background disentanglement enables mutual reinforcement: static background Gaussians anchor camera estimation via multi-view consistency; refined cameras improve human body alignment through accurate temporal correspondence; optimized human poses enhance scene reconstruction by removing dynamic artifacts from static constraints. We further introduce a temporal dynamics module to capture fine-grained pose-dependent deformations and a residual color field to model illumination variations. Extensive experiments on NeuMan and EMDB datasets demonstrate that JOintGS achieves superior reconstruction quality, with 2.1~dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods on NeuMan dataset, while maintaining real-time rendering.

However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues.

SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions.

Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions are important because they sometimes reveal our body's health problems. But it is challenging due to the inferred visual differences between disease types. This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions. This system could be a helpful support for doctors, making nail disease diagnosis more accurate and faster.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6307\u7532\u75be\u75c5\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u79cdCNN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dInceptionV3\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u738795.57%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u548cSHAP\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6307\u7532\u75be\u75c5\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u5168\u8eab\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u51c6\u786e\u8bca\u65ad\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff1b\u7136\u800c\u4e0d\u540c\u75be\u75c5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u7ec6\u5fae\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc6\u522b\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b3835\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u516d\u7c7b\u6307\u7532\u75be\u75c5\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u7edf\u4e00\u8c03\u6574\u4e3a224\u00d7224\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83InceptionV3\u3001DenseNet201\u3001EfficientNetV2\u548cResNet50\u56db\u79cdCNN\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528SHAP\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "InceptionV3\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe95.57%\uff0cDenseNet201\u6b21\u4e4b\uff0894.79%\uff09\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0cSHAP\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6307\u7532\u75be\u75c5\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Our method consists of an encoder that requires only a few RGB template views depicting an object to generate a sparse object-like point cloud using a learned UDF containing semantic and geometric information. Next, a decoder takes the object encoding together with a query image to generate a variety of dense predictions. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method can be used for few-shot object perception without requiring any camera-specific parameters or retraining on target data. Our proposed concept of outsourcing object information in a NeMO and using a single network for multiple perception tasks enhances interaction with novel objects, improving scalability and efficiency by enabling quick object onboarding without retraining or extensive pre-processing.

Stage-wise Attention-Guided Adversarial Attack on Large Vision Language Models", "comment": "Pre-print", "summary": "Adversarial attacks against Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are crucial for exposing safety vulnerabilities in modern multimodal systems. Recent attacks based on input transformations, such as random cropping, suggest that spatially localized perturbations can be more effective than global image manipulation. However, randomly cropping the entire image is inherently stochastic and fails to use the limited per-pixel perturbation budget efficiently. We make two key observations: (i) regional attention scores are positively correlated with adversarial loss sensitivity, and (ii) attacking high-attention regions induces a structured redistribution of attention toward subsequent salient regions. Based on these findings, we propose Stage-wise Attention-Guided Attack (SAGA), an attention-guided framework that progressively concentrates perturbations on high-attention regions. SAGA enables more efficient use of constrained perturbation budgets, producing highly imperceptible adversarial examples while consistently achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across ten LVLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/jackwaky/SAGA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSAGA\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u6270\u52a8\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u9ad8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u88c1\u526a\u7b49\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u533a\u57df\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u635f\u5931\u654f\u611f\u6027\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4e14\u653b\u51fb\u9ad8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u533a\u57df\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5411\u5176\u4ed6\u663e\u8457\u533a\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSAGA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u6270\u52a8\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "SAGA\u5728\u5341\u4e2aLVLM\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6307\u5bfc\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u5206\u914d\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0cSAGA\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LVLM\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Recently, some MMIF methods incorporate frequency domain information to enhance spatial features. However, these methods typically rely on simple serial or parallel spatial-frequency fusion without interaction. In this paper, we propose a novel Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion Mamba (ISFM) framework for MMIF. Specifically, we begin with a Modality-Specific Extractor (MSE) to extract features from different modalities. It models long-range dependencies across the image with linear computational complexity. To effectively leverage frequency information, we then propose a Multi-scale Frequency Fusion (MFF). It adaptively integrates low-frequency and high-frequency components across multiple scales, enabling robust representations of frequency features. More importantly, we further propose an Interactive Spatial-Frequency Fusion (ISF). It incorporates frequency features to guide spatial features across modalities, enhancing complementary representations. Extensive experiments are conducted on six MMIF datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our ISFM can achieve better performances than other state-of-the-art methods.

Recent diffusion-based restoration methods commonly adapt pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, where the variational autoencoder (VAE) can significantly bottleneck restoration fidelity. We propose LCUDiff, a stable one-step framework that upgrades a pre-trained latent diffusion model from the 4-channel latent space to the 16-channel latent space. For VAE fine-tuning, channel splitting distillation (CSD) is used to keep the first four channels aligned with pre-trained priors while allocating the additional channels to effectively encode high-frequency details. We further design prior-preserving adaptation (PPA) to smoothly bridge the mismatch between 4-channel diffusion backbones and the higher-dimensional 16-channel latent. In addition, we propose a decoder router (DeR) for per-sample decoder routing using restoration-quality score annotations, which improves visual quality across diverse conditions.

Global-reference becomes ambiguous under multiple motions, while the local pointmap relies heavily on estimated relative poses and can drift, causing cross-frame misalignment and duplicated structures. We propose TrajVG, a reconstruction framework that makes cross-frame 3D correspondence an explicit prediction by estimating camera-coordinate 3D trajectories. We couple sparse trajectories, per-frame local point maps, and relative camera poses with geometric consistency objectives: (i) bidirectional trajectory-pointmap consistency with controlled gradient flow, and (ii) a pose consistency objective driven by static track anchors that suppresses gradients from dynamic regions. To scale training to in-the-wild videos where 3D trajectory labels are scarce, we reformulate the same coupling constraints into self-supervised objectives using only pseudo 2D tracks, enabling unified training with mixed supervision.

While recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have endowed segmentation systems with reasoning capabilities, these efforts remain confined by the frozen internal knowledge of MLLMs, which limits their potential for real-world scenarios that involve up-to-date information or domain-specific concepts. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Seg-ReSearch}, a novel segmentation paradigm that overcomes the knowledge bottleneck of existing approaches. By enabling interleaved reasoning and external search, Seg-ReSearch empowers segmentation systems to handle dynamic, open-world queries that extend beyond the frozen knowledge of MLLMs. To effectively train this capability, we introduce a hierarchical reward design that harmonizes initial guidance with progressive incentives, mitigating the dilemma between sparse outcome signals and rigid step-wise supervision. For evaluation, we construct OK-VOS, a challenging benchmark that explicitly requires outside knowledge for video object segmentation.

Importantly, the visual system processes with high resolution only the center of its field of view and learns similar representations for visual inputs occurring close in time. This emphasizes slowly changing information around gaze locations. This study investigates the role of central vision and slowness learning in the formation of semantic object representations from human-like visual experience. We simulate five months of human-like visual experience using the Ego4D dataset and generate gaze coordinates with a state-of-the-art gaze prediction model. Using these predictions, we extract crops that mimic central vision and train a time-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning model on them. Our results show that combining temporal slowness and central vision improves the encoding of different semantic facets of object representations. Specifically, focusing on central vision strengthens the extraction of foreground object features, while considering temporal slowness, especially during fixational eye movements, allows the model to encode broader semantic information about objects. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which humans may develop semantic object representations from natural visual experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528Ego4D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e94\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u91ce\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6162\u53d8\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8c\u8005\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u7269\u4f53\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6781\u5c11\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u4ece\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u4e2d\u4e60\u5f97\u8bed\u4e49\u7269\u4f53\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5176\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u91ce\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u90bb\u8fd1\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5f62\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u91ce\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u6162\u53d8\u6027\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\u5f62\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Ego4D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u8fdb\u773c\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6ce8\u89c6\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u91ce\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u88c1\u526a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5176\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u6162\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u91ce\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7f16\u7801\u7269\u4f53\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u9762\uff1a\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u91ce\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u53d6\u524d\u666f\u7269\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u65f6\u95f4\u6162\u53d8\u6027\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6ce8\u89c6\u773c\u52a8\u671f\u95f4\uff09\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u592e\u89c6\u91ce\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u6162\u53d8\u673a\u5236\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u7269\u4f53\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, most existing models perform diffusion in the pixel space and train distinct models for different multispectral (MS) imagery, suffering from high latency and sensor-specific limitations. In this paper, we present SALAD-Pan, a sensor-agnostic latent space diffusion method for efficient pansharpening. Specifically, SALAD-Pan trains a band-wise single-channel VAE to encode high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) into compact latent representations, supporting MS images with various channel counts and establishing a basis for acceleration. Then spectral physical properties, along with PAN and MS images, are injected into the diffusion backbone through unidirectional and bidirectional interactive control structures respectively, achieving high-precision fusion in the diffusion process. Finally, a lightweight cross-spectral attention module is added to the central layer of diffusion model, reinforcing spectral connections to boost spectral consistency and further elevate fusion precision. Experimental results on GaoFen-2, QuickBird, and WorldView-3 demonstrate that SALAD-Pan outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods across all three datasets, attains a 2-3x inference speedup, and exhibits robust zero-shot (cross-sensor) capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSALAD-Pan\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u5168\u8272\u9510\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u67092-3\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u8272\u9510\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u5f71\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "SALAD-Pan\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u901a\u9053\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u5c06\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5411\u4e0e\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a7\u5236\u7ed3\u6784\u6ce8\u5165\u5149\u8c31\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5168\u8272/\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5c42\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8de8\u5149\u8c31\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5149\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728GaoFen-2\u3001QuickBird\u548cWorldView-3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSALAD-Pan\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472-3\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\uff08\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff09\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SALAD-Pan\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5168\u8272\u9510\u5316\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we introduce Vision-aligned Latent Reasoning (VaLR), a simple, yet effective reasoning framework that dynamically generates vision-aligned latent tokens before each Chain of Thought reasoning step, guiding the model to reason based on perceptual cues in the latent space. Specifically, VaLR is trained to preserve visual knowledge during reasoning by aligning intermediate embeddings of MLLM with those from vision encoders.

However, extending these models to large-scale RGB stream 3D reconstruction remains challenging due to memory limitations. This work proposes S-MUSt3R, a simple and efficient pipeline that extends the limits of foundation models for monocular 3D reconstruction. Our approach addresses the scalability bottleneck of foundation models through a simple strategy of sequence segmentation followed by segment alignment and lightweight loop closure optimization. Without model retraining, we benefit from remarkable 3D reconstruction capacities of MUSt3R model and achieve trajectory and reconstruction performance comparable to traditional methods with more complex architecture. We evaluate S-MUSt3R on TUM, 7-Scenes and proprietary robot navigation datasets and show that S-MUSt3R runs successfully on long RGB sequences and produces accurate and consistent 3D reconstruction. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging the MUSt3R model for scalable monocular 3D scene in real-world settings, with an important advantage of making predictions directly in the metric space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faS-MUSt3R\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6bb5\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u95ed\u73af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c06MUSt3R\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5355\u76eeRGB\u89c6\u9891\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u672a\u6821\u51c6\u56fe\u50cf\u76843D\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21RGB\u6d41\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "S-MUSt3R\u91c7\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u82e5\u5e72\u6bb5\uff0c\u5229\u7528MUSt3R\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u91cd\u5efa\u6bcf\u4e00\u6bb5\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u6bb5\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u95ed\u73af\u4f18\u5316\u6574\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728TUM\u30017-Scenes\u53ca\u81ea\u91c7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cS-MUSt3R\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217RGB\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "S-MUSt3R\u6709\u6548\u91ca\u653e\u4e86MUSt3R\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5355\u76ee3D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at qualitative description, they often fall short in understanding the parametric physics underlying image degradations. In this work, we redefine degradation understanding as a hierarchical structured prediction task, necessitating the concurrent estimation of degradation types, parameter keys, and their continuous physical values. Although these sub-tasks operate in disparate spaces, we prove that they can be unified under one autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm, whose error is bounded by the value-space quantization grid. Building on this insight, we introduce DU-VLM, a multimodal chain-of-thought model trained with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning using structured rewards. Furthermore, we show that DU-VLM can serve as a zero-shot controller for pre-trained diffusion models, enabling high-fidelity image restoration without fine-tuning the generative backbone.

In the context of 360-degree video, it has been particularly valuable for tasks such as viewport prediction and immersive content optimization. In this paper, we propose SalFormer360, a novel saliency estimation model for 360-degree videos built on a transformer-based architecture. Our approach is based on the combination of an existing encoder architecture, SegFormer, and a custom decoder. The SegFormer model was originally developed for 2D segmentation tasks, and it has been fine-tuned to adapt it to 360-degree content.

Unlike natural images, multiplex imaging lacks a fixed channel space, as real-world marker sets vary across studies, violating a core assumption of standard vision backbones. To address this, ImmuVis introduces marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions that generate convolutional kernels from learned marker embeddings, enabling a single model to operate on arbitrary measured marker subsets without retraining. We pretrain ImmuVis on the largest to-date dataset, IMC17M (28 cohorts, 24,405 images, 265 markers, over 17M patches), using self-supervised masked reconstruction. ImmuVis outperforms SOTA baselines and ablations in virtual staining and downstream classification tasks at substantially lower compute cost than transformer-based alternatives, and is the sole model that provides calibrated uncertainty via a heteroscedastic likelihood objective.

However, current methods face two prohibitive barriers: (1) reliance on neural rendering often yields fragmented, non-simulation-ready geometries under heavy occlusion, and (2) dependence on brittle Structure-from-Motion (SfM) initialization leads to frequent failures on in-the-wild footage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce AGILE, a robust framework that shifts the paradigm from reconstruction to agentic generation for interaction learning. First, we employ an agentic pipeline where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) guides a generative model to synthesize a complete, watertight object mesh with high-fidelity texture, independent of video occlusions. Second, bypassing fragile SfM entirely, we propose a robust anchor-and-track strategy. We initialize the object pose at a single interaction onset frame using a foundation model and propagate it temporally by leveraging the strong visual similarity between our generated asset and video observations. Finally, a contact-aware optimization integrates semantic, geometric, and interaction stability constraints to enforce physical plausibility. Extensive experiments on HO3D, DexYCB, and in-the-wild videos reveal that AGILE outperforms baselines in global geometric accuracy while demonstrating exceptional robustness on challenging sequences where prior art frequently collapses.

However, their potential in space-related applications remains largely unexplored. In the space domain, accurate manual annotation is particularly challenging due to factors such as low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds. Developing methods that can detect and segment spacecraft and orbital targets without requiring extensive manual labeling is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we propose an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using VLMs. Our approach begins by automatically generating pseudo-labels for a small subset of unlabeled real data with a pre-trained VLM. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged in a teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models. Despite the inherent noise in the pseudo-labels, the distillation process leads to substantial performance gains over direct zero-shot VLM inference. Experimental evaluations on the SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets on segmentation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points.

In recent years, computer vision has been used to automate several tasks in precision agriculture, such as detecting and counting fruits, and estimating their size. However, the fundamental problem of matching the exact same fruits from one video, collected on a given date, to the fruits visible in another video, collected on a later date, which is needed to track fruits' growth through time, remains to be solved. Few attempts were made, but they either assume that the camera always starts from the same known position and that there are sufficiently distinct features to match, or they used other sources of data like GPS. Here we propose a new paradigm to tackle this problem, based on constellations of 3D centroids, and introduce a descriptor for very sparse 3D point clouds that can be used to match fruits across videos. Matching constellations instead of individual fruits is key to deal with non-rigidity, occlusions and challenging imagery with few distinct visual features to track. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully used to match fruits across videos and through time, and also to build an orchard map and later use it to locate the camera pose in 6DoF, thus providing a method for autonomous navigation of robots in the orchard and for selective fruit picking, for example.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u8d28\u5fc3\u661f\u5ea7\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u679c\u56ed\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5339\u914d\u679c\u5b9e\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u679c\u5b9e\u751f\u957f\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u679c\u56ed\u5efa\u56fe\u53ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u6d4b\u91cf\u679c\u5b9e\u5927\u5c0f\u8d39\u65f6\u8d39\u529b\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u5339\u914d\u540c\u4e00\u679c\u5b9e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u8457\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u5b58\u5728\u906e\u6321\u6216\u975e\u521a\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5339\u914d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u679c\u5b9e\u89c6\u4e3a3D\u8d28\u5fc3\u6784\u6210\u7684\u201c\u661f\u5ea7\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f3D\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5339\u914d\u661f\u5ea7\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e2a\u679c\u5b9e\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u3001\u975e\u521a\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8de8\u89c6\u9891\u5339\u914d\u679c\u5b9e\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u679c\u5b9e\u751f\u957f\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u679c\u56ed\u5730\u56fe\u53ca6\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u679c\u56ed\u4e2d\u679c\u5b9e\u957f\u671f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91c7\u6458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While existing sparse attention solutions have shown promise on bidirectional models, we identify that applying these solutions to AR models leads to considerable performance degradation for two reasons: isolated consideration of chunk generation and insufficient utilization of past informative context. Motivated by these observations, we propose \\textsc{Light Forcing}, the \\textit{first} sparse attention solution tailored for AR video generation models. It incorporates a \\textit{Chunk-Aware Growth} mechanism to quantitatively estimate the contribution of each chunk, which determines their sparsity allocation. This progressive sparsity increase strategy enables the current chunk to inherit prior knowledge in earlier chunks during generation. Additionally, we introduce a \\textit{Hierarchical Sparse Attention} to capture informative historical and local context in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such two-level mask selection strategy (\\ie, frame and block level) can adaptively handle diverse attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (\\eg, 84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (\\eg, $1.2{\\sim}1.3\\times$ end-to-end speedup).

In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels.

Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development.

Practical analysis of this data depends crucially on available neighborhood descriptors to accurately characterize the local geometries of the point cloud. This paper introduces LitS, a novel neighborhood descriptor for 2D and 3D point clouds. LitS are piecewise constant functions on the unit circle that allow points to keep track of their surroundings. Each element in LitS' domain represents a direction with respect to a local reference system. Once constructed, evaluating LitS at any given direction gives us information about the number of neighbors in a cone-like region centered around that same direction. Thus, LitS conveys a lot of information about the local neighborhood of a point, which can be leveraged to gain global structural understanding by analyzing how LitS changes between close points. In addition, LitS comes in two versions ('regular' and 'cumulative') and has two parameters, allowing them to adapt to various contexts and types of point clouds. Overall, they are a versatile neighborhood descriptor, capable of capturing the nuances of local point arrangements and resilient to common point cloud data issues such as variable density and noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLitS\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u90bb\u57df\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u523b\u753b2D\u548c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u90bb\u57df\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u523b\u753b\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u3002", "method": "LitS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u5355\u4f4d\u5706\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u6bb5\u5e38\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u8868\u793a\u90bb\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u7ed9\u5b9a\u65b9\u5411\u4e0aLitS\u7684\u503c\u53cd\u6620\u8be5\u65b9\u5411\u9525\u5f62\u533a\u57df\u5185\u90bb\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u3002LitS\u63d0\u4f9b\u201c\u5e38\u89c4\u201d\u548c\u201c\u7d2f\u79ef\u201d\u4e24\u79cd\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "LitS\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u70b9\u4e91\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u76f8\u90bb\u70b9LitS\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5206\u6790\u83b7\u5f97\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u70b9\u4e91\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u548c\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LitS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u90bb\u57df\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u523b\u753b\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens.

State-of-the-art trackers typically rely on cost volumes to match features across frames, but this approach incurs quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose \\method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks. These results suggest that warping-based architectures can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4f53\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7a20\u5bc6\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u626d\u66f2\u548cTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5149\u6d41\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a20\u5bc6\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u5e27\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u626d\u66f2\uff08warping\uff09\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d7\u5149\u6d41\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u5e27\u7279\u5f81\u6839\u636e\u5f53\u524d\u4f30\u8ba1\u626d\u66f2\u5230\u67e5\u8be2\u5e27\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u6240\u6709\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728TAP-Vid-DAVIS\u3001TAP-Vid-Kinetics\u548cRobo-TAP\u7b49\u7a20\u5bc6\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5728Sintel\u3001KITTI\u548cSpring\u7b49\u5149\u6d41\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6709\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7edf\u4e00\u7a20\u5bc6\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0e\u5149\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
