TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于多模态遥感数据微调地理空间基础模型（TerraMind）在全球洪水范围制图中的表现，发现微调后的基础模型在精度与计算成本之间取得良好平衡，而U-Net在召回率上更优；研究表明融合光学与SAR数据并微调GFM有助于提升近实时洪水制图能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端洪水事件频发，亟需高精度、可泛化的遥感洪水制图方法；尽管地理空间基础模型（如TerraMind）通过自监督预训练提升了泛化能力，但其在全球多样化洪水事件中的实际性能尚不明确。

Method: 利用包含85个全球洪水事件的多模态数据集FloodsNet（配准的Sentinel-1 SAR和Sentinel-2光学影像），对TerraMind模型进行微调，测试四种配置（基础/大模型、冻结/非冻结主干），并与TerraMind官方示例及U-Net模型进行对比。

Result: 基础-非冻结配置在准确率、精确率和召回率之间取得最佳平衡且计算成本较低；大模型-非冻结配置召回率最高；FloodsNet训练的模型在召回率上优于Sen1Floods11训练的示例；U-Net召回率高于所有GFM配置，但准确率和精确率略低。

Conclusion: 微调地理空间基础模型并融合多模态遥感数据可有效提升近实时洪水制图能力，该研究为GFM在全球洪水分割任务中的应用提供了重要实证依据，同时揭示了其在气候适应与灾害韧性建设中的潜力与局限。

Abstract: Floods are among the most damaging weather-related hazards, and in 2024, the warmest year on record, extreme flood events affected communities across five continents. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.
  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.
  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both its potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

### [2] [Context-Enriched Contrastive Loss: Enhancing Presentation of Inherent Sample Connections in Contrastive Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02152)
*Haojin Deng,Yimin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种上下文增强的对比损失函数，通过两个收敛目标提升对比学习效果并缓解信息失真问题，在多个大规模图像分类基准上优于16种现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准对比学习在数据增强过程中可能引入信息失真，模型过度依赖同类样本信息而忽视来自同一原始图像的正样本对，尤其在大规模数据集中更为显著。

Method: 提出一种包含两个组成部分的上下文增强对比损失函数：一是增强类别间特征区分能力，提高对比训练效率；二是拉近来自同一源图像的增强样本，同时推远其他样本。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100、Caltech-101、Caltech-256、ImageNet、BiasedMNIST、UTKFace和CelebA等8个大规模图像分类数据集上验证，所提方法在泛化性能和收敛速度上均优于16种前沿对比学习方法，尤其在BiasedMNIST上相较原始对比损失提升22.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了对比学习中的信息失真问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和训练效率，尤其适用于存在系统性偏差的下游任务。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.

### [3] [FineGRAIN: Evaluating Failure Modes of Text-to-Image Models with Vision Language Model Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02161)
*Kevin David Hayes,Micah Goldblum,Vikash Sehwag,Gowthami Somepalli,Ashwinee Panda,Tom Goldstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种联合评估文本到图像（T2I）模型与视觉语言模型（VLM）的方法，通过检测VLM是否能识别T2I模型在复杂提示下生成图像中的27种具体失败模式。研究构建了一个包含5个T2I模型生成图像及其对应VLM标注的数据集，并发现当前评估指标难以捕捉属性保真度和对象表示中的系统性错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型常无法准确遵循用户提示中的具体属性（如颜色、数量等），而VLM的评测基准也未能跟上其实际应用场景的复杂性，因此亟需一种更细粒度、分层的评估框架来衡量模型对提示的忠实度。

Method: 作者设计了一套结构化方法，利用VLM（如Molmo、InternVL3、Pixtral）判断T2I模型（如Flux、SD3系列）在挑战性提示下生成图像是否存在27类预定义失败模式，并由LLM（Llama3）对VLM的判断进行标注和验证。

Result: 分析揭示了T2I模型在属性一致性和对象表示方面存在系统性错误，且当前通用评估指标难以有效反映这些细微但关键的问题。

Conclusion: 针对T2I与VLM的联合评估表明，需要构建更具针对性的评测基准，以提升生成模型的可靠性与可解释性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

### [4] [Mapping of Lesion Images to Somatic Mutations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02162)
*Rahul Mehta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为LLOST的深度潜在变量模型，通过将病灶医学图像（以点云形式表示）与体细胞突变数据在共享潜在空间中联合建模，从而基于医学影像预测患者的体细胞突变谱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癌症治疗的效果高度依赖于早期诊断和干预。医学影像是临床初步诊断的关键工具，而基因信息则用于后续制定个体化治疗方案。因此，作者旨在建立一个模型，仅基于医学图像预测患者的体细胞突变情况，以加速精准诊疗流程。

Method: 作者首先将病灶图像转换为点云表示以实现对成像模态的不变性。随后提出LLOST模型，该模型包含两个变分自编码器（分别处理点云和突变计数），并通过一个独立的共享潜在空间进行耦合。三个潜在空间（两个私有，一个共享）均使用条件标准化流（conditional normalizing flow）先验进行学习，以捕捉各领域数据的复杂分布。

Result: 在来自The Cancer Imaging Archive的去标识化医学图像和The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer数据集的体细胞突变数据上进行的实验表明，该模型不仅能有效预测特定突变的发生与否，还能准确预测其计数，并揭示了影像特征与突变模式之间反映癌症类型的共享关联。

Conclusion: LLOST模型成功地建立了医学影像与体细胞突变之间的联系，展示了基于影像预测基因突变的可行性。作者最后讨论了模型的改进方向，并建议未来研究可纳入其他遗传学数据域。

Abstract: Medical imaging is a critical initial tool used by clinicians to determine a patient's cancer diagnosis, allowing for faster intervention and more reliable patient prognosis. At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.

### [5] [SplatSuRe: Selective Super-Resolution for Multi-view Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02172)
*Pranav Asthana,Alex Hanson,Allen Tu,Tom Goldstein,Matthias Zwicker,Amitabh Varshney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatSuRe is a novel method that selectively applies super-resolution (SR) to undersampled regions in 3D Gaussian Splatting, guided by camera pose and scene geometry, achieving sharper and more consistent high-resolution renders than existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing super-resolution methods for 3D Gaussian Splatting apply SR uniformly across all views, causing multi-view inconsistencies and blurry results; the authors aim to address this by leveraging geometric and pose information to apply SR only where needed.

Method: The proposed method, SplatSuRe, uses camera pose relative to scene geometry to identify undersampled regions lacking high-frequency detail and selectively enhances only those areas with super-resolution, avoiding unnecessary or inconsistent SR application.

Result: SplatSuRe outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and perceptual quality on datasets like Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF 360, with the most noticeable improvements in detailed foreground regions.

Conclusion: By selectively applying super-resolution based on geometric context, SplatSuRe achieves more consistent and higher-quality novel view synthesis, especially in regions requiring fine detail.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

### [6] [See, Hear, and Understand: Benchmarking Audiovisual Human Speech Understanding in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02231)
*Le Thien Phuc Nguyen,Zhuoran Yu,Samuel Low Yu Hang,Subin An,Jeongik Lee,Yohan Ban,SeungEun Chung,Thanh-Huy Nguyen,JuWan Maeng,Soochahn Lee,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了AV-SpeakerBench，一个包含3,212道多项选择题的音视频基准，专注于现实视频中以说话者为中心的细粒度视听推理，评估多模态大语言模型对“谁在何时说了什么”的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准很少评估模型对人类语音的细粒度推理能力，多数任务仅依赖视觉信息或粗略评估语音，难以衡量模型是否能准确对齐说话者、话语内容与时间。

Method: 构建AV-SpeakerBench基准，其特点包括：(1) 以说话者而非场景为核心推理单元；(2) 问题设计融合音视频依赖关系；(3) 由专家标注确保时间精度和跨模态有效性。

Result: 评估显示Gemini系列模型表现最优，其中Gemini 2.5 Pro领先；开源模型中Qwen3-Omni-30B接近Gemini 2.0 Flash，但远落后于Gemini 2.5 Pro，主要受限于音视频融合能力而非视觉感知。

Conclusion: AV-SpeakerBench为未来多模态系统在细粒度音视频推理方面提供了严谨的评估基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

### [7] [Exploring the Potentials of Spiking Neural Networks for Image Deraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02258)
*Shuang Chen,Tomas Krajnik,Farshad Arvin,Amir Atapour-Abarghouei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新型视觉LIF（VLIF）神经元和基于SNN的图像去雨框架，显著优于现有SNN方法，并仅消耗其13%的能量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脉冲神经元在低层视觉任务（如图像去雨）中缺乏空间上下文理解能力，且在频域存在饱和问题，限制了SNN在此类任务中的应用。

Method: 提出了具有高通特性的Visual LIF（VLIF）神经元，并设计了脉冲分解增强模块与轻量级多尺度单元，用于层次化多尺度表征学习。

Result: 在五个去雨基准数据集上显著优于当前最先进的SNN去雨方法，同时仅消耗其13%的能量。

Conclusion: 该研究为在高性能、低功耗的低层视觉任务中部署SNN奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

### [8] [Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flow Matching for Climate Emulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02268)
*Jeremy Andrew Irvin,Jiaqi Han,Zikui Wang,Abdulaziz Alharbi,Yufei Zhao,Nomin-Erdene Bayarsaikhan,Daniele Visioni,Andrew Y. Ng,Duncan Watson-Parris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了时空金字塔流（SPF），一种新的流匹配方法，用于高效、多尺度地模拟气候变化。SPF通过在空间和时间尺度上分层建模，实现快速并行采样，并在ClimateBench和新构建的ClimateSuite数据集上展示了优越性能和良好泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型依赖天气尺度的自回归方法进行气候模拟，但该方法在长期气候预测中速度慢，且在非平稳外强迫下难以稳定运行。因此，需要一种更高效、稳定且能处理多时间尺度的气候模拟方法。

Method: 提出时空金字塔流（SPF）方法，受级联视频模型启发，将生成过程划分为时空金字塔结构，在不同层级逐步提升空间分辨率并关联对应时间尺度，实现任意时间层级的直接采样；同时在每个阶段引入物理外强迫（如温室气体、气溶胶）作为条件，支持多尺度并行气候模拟。

Result: 在ClimateBench基准上，SPF在年和月时间尺度上优于现有强基线模型和预训练模型，且采样速度更快（尤其在较粗时间尺度）。利用新构建的大规模数据集ClimateSuite（包含超过33,000个模拟年、10个气候模型及首个气候干预模拟数据），扩展后的SPF模型在未见情景和不同气候模型上表现出良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPF与ClimateSuite共同为跨时间尺度、面向真实未来情景的高效、准确、概率性气候模拟提供了坚实基础，相关数据与代码已开源。

Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios. Data and code is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/spf .

### [9] [Progressive Image Restoration via Text-Conditioned Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02273)
*Peng Kang,Xijun Wang,Yu Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文将文本到视频模型CogVideo重新用于图像恢复任务，通过微调使其生成从退化到清晰的渐进式恢复序列，在超分辨率、去模糊和低光增强任务中取得良好效果，并展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管当前文本到视频模型在时序生成方面表现优异，但其在图像恢复领域的潜力尚未被充分挖掘。作者旨在探索如何利用这类模型的时序建模能力来完成渐进式视觉恢复任务。

Method: 构建包含从退化到清晰帧的合成数据集，对CogVideo进行微调以学习恢复轨迹；采用两种提示策略（统一文本提示与基于LLaVA和ChatGPT生成的场景特定提示）引导模型生成恢复序列。

Result: 模型在多个感知指标（PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS）上随帧提升，能有效恢复空间细节与光照一致性，保持时序连贯性，并在未训练的真实世界ReLoBlur数据集上展现零样本鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CogVideo经适当微调后可成功应用于图像恢复任务，不仅在合成数据上表现优异，还能在真实场景中实现高质量、可解释的渐进式恢复，验证了文本到视频模型在非自然运动任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

### [10] [Enhancing Cross Domain SAR Oil Spill Segmentation via Morphological Region Perturbation and Synthetic Label-to-SAR Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02290)
*Andre Juarez,Luis Salsavilca,Frida Coaquira,Celso Gonzales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出MORP--Synth，一种两阶段合成增强框架，通过形态扰动和SAR纹理生成提升地中海训练模型在秘鲁海域溢油分割的泛化能力，在稀缺标注数据条件下显著提高mIoU及少数类IoU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在SAR溢油分割任务中因海况、后向散射统计和油膜形态差异而难以跨区域泛化，尤其在秘鲁海岸缺乏标注Sentinel-1数据的情况下问题更为严重。

Method: MORP--Synth包含两个阶段：阶段A采用曲率引导的形态区域扰动（Morphological Region Perturbation）在标签空间生成逼真的油污与类油区域几何变化；阶段B利用条件生成INADE模型从编辑后的掩码渲染出类SAR纹理。

Result: 构建了包含2112个512×512标注图像块的秘鲁数据集，并评估七种分割架构。仅用地中海数据预训练的模型在秘鲁域上mIoU从67.8%降至51.8%，而MORP--Synth将性能提升最多6个mIoU点，并显著提高少数类IoU（油污+10.8，类油+14.6）。

Conclusion: MORP--Synth有效缓解了跨区域SAR溢油分割中的域偏移问题，在标注数据稀缺的秘鲁海域显著提升了模型泛化能力和分割精度。

Abstract: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation often fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, a limitation that is particularly severe along the Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data remain scarce. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{MORP--Synth}, a two-stage synthetic augmentation framework designed to improve transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions. Stage~A applies Morphological Region Perturbation, a curvature guided label space method that generates realistic geometric variations of oil and look-alike regions. Stage~B renders SAR-like textures from the edited masks using a conditional generative INADE model. We compile a Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled 512$\times$512 patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014--2024), harmonized with the Mediterranean CleanSeaNet benchmark, and evaluate seven segmentation architectures. Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8\% to 51.8\% mIoU on the Peruvian domain; MORP--Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

*Chenshuang Zhang,Kang Zhang,Joon Son Chung,In So Kweon,Junmo Kim,Chengzhi Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于预训练视频扩散模型的自监督跟踪方法，利用其在高噪声阶段学习到的运动表征，在无需任务特定训练的情况下显著提升对视觉上相似物体的区分与跟踪能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督跟踪器在视觉线索模糊时表现不佳，难以扩展和泛化；而监督方法依赖大量标注数据。作者旨在探索无需标签即可有效区分外观相似目标的跟踪方案。

Method: 利用预训练视频扩散模型在去噪早期阶段天然学到的运动表征进行自监督跟踪，该阶段能分离运动信息与外观细节，从而实现对视觉相似对象的鲁棒跟踪。

Result: 在标准基准及新引入的视觉相似目标测试集上，该方法相较近期自监督方法最高提升6个百分点，并能有效应对视角变化和形变等挑战。

Conclusion: 视频扩散模型蕴含强大的运动表征能力，可直接用于自监督跟踪任务，尤其在处理视觉相似对象这一难点问题上展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于薄板样条（Thin Plate Spline）的高自由度、长期对齐框架TALO，用于提升3D视觉基础模型在时序场景（如自动驾驶）中预测结果的时间一致性。该方法通过全局传播的控制点校正空间变化的不一致性，并采用与点无关的子图配准设计以增强对噪声几何的鲁棒性。TALO具有即插即用特性，兼容多种3D基础模型和相机配置，在多个数据集和设置下均显著提升了几何一致性和轨迹精度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有3D视觉基础模型在在线场景（如自动驾驶）中难以维持时序预测的一致性；当前基于全局变换的对齐策略存在假设有效性不足、局部对齐范围有限以及对噪声几何鲁棒性差等根本性局限。

Method: 提出一种基于薄板样条（Thin Plate Spline）的高自由度、长期对齐框架，利用全局传播的控制点进行空间变化不一致性的校正，并采用点无关的子图配准机制以提高对噪声几何的鲁棒性；该框架为即插即用设计，兼容不同3D基础模型和相机配置。

Conclusion: 所提出的TALO框架有效解决了3D基础模型在时序应用中的时间一致性问题，具备良好的泛化能力与实用性，且代码已开源。

Abstract: 3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

*Shwai He,Chaorui Deng,Ang Li,Shen Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了统一多模态模型中的推理效率问题，发现理解组件具有较高的可压缩性，而生成组件对压缩敏感。为此，作者提出基于专家混合（MoE）的稀疏激活方法，在仅激活约一半参数的情况下恢复生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多模态模型虽能同时支持理解和生成任务，但存在推理效率低下的问题，部分任务或样本并不需要完整模型容量，因此需系统分析各组件对压缩的敏感性并提升效率。

Method: 采用无需训练的剪枝方法（包括深度剪枝和宽度缩减）对统一多模态模型各组件进行系统分析；基于观察到的动态激活模式，提出Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）自适应方法，将生成模块划分为多个专家并实现稀疏激活。

Result: 实验表明理解组件在理解和生成任务中均可高度压缩，而生成组件对压缩敏感；所提MoE自适应方法通过稀疏激活显著恢复生成质量，在仅激活约50%参数的情况下达到与完整模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 统一多模态模型中不同组件对压缩的敏感性存在显著差异，通过引入MoE稀疏激活机制可有效提升推理效率而不牺牲性能，为高效统一多模态模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters. The code is released at \href{https://github.com/Shwai-He/SparseUnifiedModel}{this link}.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种弱监督、无需标定的多视角人群计数方法（WSCF-MVCC），仅使用人群总数作为监督信号，结合自监督排序损失和语义信息提升计数精度，在三个数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的弱监督、免标定多视角人群计数方法显著降低了对标注数据的依赖，同时保持高精度，更适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting can effectively mitigate occlusion issues that commonly arise in single-image crowd counting. Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods. Code is released in https://github.com/zqyq/Weakly-MVCC.

TL;DR: 本文提出VACoT框架，在推理阶段动态调用图像增强操作，通过后处理变换（如去噪）提升视觉语言模型在分布外和对抗性输入（尤其是OCR任务）中的鲁棒性，避免了传统训练增强带来的高成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在训练中较少使用视觉数据增强，主要依赖大规模真实数据或合成数据，导致其在基础感知任务上表现不佳；而继续在增强数据上训练VLM成本高、收益递减。

Method: 提出VACoT框架，在推理时动态引入一系列通用视觉增强操作（而非仅局部裁剪），并通过高效的智能体强化学习与条件奖励机制，鼓励必要增强、抑制冗余响应，实现简洁有效的感知推理。

Result: 在13个感知基准上验证了VACoT的优越性，并构建AdvOCR数据集，证明后处理视觉增强在对抗场景中能显著提升模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: VACoT通过推理阶段的动态视觉增强有效提升了VLM在挑战性和对抗性输入下的鲁棒性，同时降低了训练复杂度与计算开销，为视觉语言模型的感知能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: While visual data augmentation remains a cornerstone for training robust vision models, it has received limited attention in visual language models (VLMs), which predominantly rely on large-scale real data acquisition or synthetic diversity. Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.

Conclusion: 机器学习模型，尤其是轻量级模型如SqueezeNet，在TB检测中具有显著潜力，适用于移动设备部署以支持资源匮乏地区的早期诊断，但仍需进一步优化模型的速度、体积和准确性以助力全球TB防控。

Abstract: This study explores the application of machine learning models, specifically a pretrained ResNet-50 model and a general SqueezeNet model, in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) using chest X-ray images. TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios. Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder. Under the supervision of patch-level and point-level losses, we obtain reasonable trajectory results. Experiments on Nuscences datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, validating its effectiveness in handling complex interactive scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SAGE框架，在无法访问模型参数和结构的隐私约束下，通过生成自适应视觉提示来提升冻结模型在语义分割任务中的域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中常因隐私和安全限制无法获取模型参数与架构，传统微调或域适应方法不可行，亟需不修改模型权重的输入级泛化策略。

Method: SAGE利用风格迁移构建源域多样化的风格表示，学习一组覆盖广泛视觉特征的风格特征，并根据输入图像的上下文自适应融合这些风格线索，生成动态视觉提示以协调图像外观，从而隐式对齐不同风格下的特征分布。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，SAGE在隐私约束下性能优于或媲美当前最先进方法，并在所有设置中超越完整微调基线。

Conclusion: SAGE通过闭环设计有效弥合了冻结模型不变性与未见域多样性之间的差距，为隐私受限场景下的域泛化提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization for semantic segmentation aims to mitigate the degradation in model performance caused by domain shifts. However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}tyle-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GE}neralization framework (\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

Motivation: 现有实时无人机摄影测量方法大多仅关注图像或帧序列的处理，缺乏对飞行中三维重建质量的评估及对图像采集的引导反馈，难以满足灾害响应等时效性强的应用需求。

Method: 该方法基于SfM on-the-fly，整合三个模块：(1) 在线增量式粗网格生成以动态扩展稀疏点云；(2) 在线网格质量评估并提供可操作指标；(3) 预测性路径规划用于实时轨迹优化。

Conclusion: 通过集成数据采集、处理、重建评估与在线反馈，该方法推动了从传统被动作业模式向智能自适应探索工作流的转变。

Abstract: Compared with conventional offline UAV photogrammetry, real-time UAV photogrammetry is essential for time-critical geospatial applications such as disaster response and active digital-twin maintenance. However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow. Code is now available at https://github.com/IRIS-LAB-whu/OntheflySfMFeedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端多目标跟踪方法虽在检测方面表现优异，但因共享DETR架构产生的对象嵌入在不同对象间相似度过高，缺乏跨帧实例级区分能力，导致关联准确率较低。

Method: 提出FDTA（From Detection to Association）框架，包含空间适配器（SA）引入深度感知线索以增强空间连续性，时间适配器（TA）聚合历史信息以建模时间依赖，身份适配器（IA）采用质量感知对比学习提升实例级可分性。

Conclusion: 通过显式优化对象嵌入的判别性，FDTA有效弥补了端到端MOT方法在关联阶段的不足，为提升多目标跟踪整体性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D radar highlight its potential for robust environment perception under adverse conditions, yet progress in radar semantic segmentation remains constrained by the scarcity of open source datasets and labels. The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data. In addition, we study and quantify how different fog levels affect the radar labeling performance.

Abstract: Object-goal navigation in open-vocabulary settings requires agents to locate novel objects in unseen environments, yet existing approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rate on locating unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Motivation: 当前对大型预训练视觉语言模型（VLM）进行微调的方法通常在整个数据集上训练一个通用模型，这可能损害其在未见领域的泛化能力，存在领域特异性与领域泛化能力之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出GuiDG框架：首先使用提示微调（prompt tuning）获得源领域专家模型，然后引入跨模态注意力模块，通过自适应地整合专家知识来引导视觉编码器的微调。

Result: 在标准领域泛化基准和新构建的ImageNet-DG数据集上的大量实验表明，GuiDG优于现有的先进微调方法，同时保持了较高的效率。

Conclusion: 理论分析和实验证明，相比微调单一通用模型，在划分的源域上训练多个参数高效的专家模型能带来更好的泛化性能；所提出的GuiDG框架有效提升了VLM在少样本领域泛化任务中的表现。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm for downstream adaptation, yet it faces a critical trade-off between domain specificity and domain generalization (DG) ability. Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Vision Language Models, the focus of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent tasks shifts from single-screen tasks to complex screen navigation challenges. However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.

Method: WorldMM构建三种互补记忆：情景记忆（跨多时间尺度索引事实事件）、语义记忆（持续更新高层概念知识）和视觉记忆（保留场景细节）；推理时由自适应检索智能体根据查询动态选择最相关记忆源并利用多时间粒度进行迭代检索。

Result: WorldMM在五个长视频问答基准上平均比先前最优方法提升8.4%，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: WorldMM通过融合多模态记忆和自适应多粒度检索机制，有效提升了长视频推理能力，为长时间视频理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LightHCG的轻量级因果表征驱动青光眼检测模型，通过HSIC隐空间解耦和图自编码器实现无监督因果表征学习，在显著减少参数量（比现有模型少93~99%）的同时，提高了青光眼分类性能，并支持AI驱动的干预分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于AI的青光眼检测方法在可靠性、参数效率、避免虚假相关性以及支持临床干预分析等方面仍有不足，亟需一种兼顾轻量化与因果推理能力的新模型。

Method: 提出LightHCG模型，该模型基于卷积变分自编码器（Convolutional VAE），结合HSIC（Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion）进行隐空间解耦，并利用图自编码器进行无监督因果表征学习，以捕捉视神经区域中青光眼相关物理因素之间的真实因果关系。

Result: LightHCG在青光眼分类任务中表现出优于InceptionV3、MobileNetV2和VGG16等先进视觉模型的性能，同时模型权重减少了93%至99%，并增强了AI驱动干预分析的可行性。

Conclusion: LightHCG作为一种轻量级且具备因果推理能力的青光眼检测模型，不仅提升了诊断准确性与效率，还为临床模拟和干预分析提供了新的可能性，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: As a representative optic degenerative condition, glaucoma has been a threat to millions due to its irreversibility and severe impact on human vision fields. Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合动量自蒸馏与梯度累积的方法，用于提升医疗场景下视觉-语言模型（VLM）的训练效率与性能，在单GPU上实现接近或超越SOTA的效果，尤其在小样本和零样本任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域标注数据稀缺，现有基于对比学习的VLM训练方法依赖大批次、高计算资源，难以普及；因此需开发更高效且能充分挖掘有限数据与模型知识的方法。

Method: 结合动量机制与自蒸馏，通过动量自蒸馏增强多模态学习，并将动量机制与梯度累积融合，在不增加硬件资源消耗的前提下扩大有效批次大小。

Result: 在零样本分类任务中达到SOTA水平，在小样本适应中AUC-ROC超过90%，检索任务提升2-3%，且仅用单GPU即可高效训练。

Conclusion: 所提方法在降低资源需求的同时提升了VLM在医疗场景下的性能，推动了高效多模态学习的发展。

Abstract: In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/phphuc612/MSD .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOLT是一种新框架，通过构建任务感知的正交基底实现对已有微调模型的高效复用，在面对未见任务时仅需训练少量对角系数即可实现高性能迁移，避免了传统元学习的高成本和不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据和计算资源受限的情况下，将大型预训练模型适配到未见任务仍具挑战。现有元学习方法需要额外的元训练阶段、成本高且不稳定；同时，如何有效利用日益增多的任务特定预训练模型进行高效迁移尚缺乏研究。

Method: BOLT（Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer）框架在离线阶段从多个任务向量中提取主导奇异方向并逐层正交化形成可重用基底；在线阶段冻结这些基底，仅训练每层少量对角系数，从而在任务感知的正交子空间内进行低秩、参数高效的微调。

Result: 实验表明，BOLT在未见任务上相比主流PEFT方法和典型元学习初始化方法具有更强的性能表现，同时提供无需训练的强初始化（通过聚合源任务系数并轻量重缩放）以及高效的微调路径。

Conclusion: 将模型适应限制在任务感知的正交子空间中，是一种有效且高效的未见任务迁移策略，兼顾性能与参数效率。

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.

Conclusion: nuScenes不仅是一个重要的数据资源，更在塑造自动驾驶研究范式、促进社区协作和推动技术标准化方面发挥了核心作用，为未来数据集设计和算法开发提供了宝贵经验。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been revolutionized by Deep Learning. As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了HouseLayout3D——一个面向真实世界多楼层建筑的3D布局估计新基准，并引入无需训练的基线方法MultiFloor3D，在新旧数据集上均优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D布局估计模型主要在合成的单房间或单楼层数据集上训练，难以处理大型多楼层建筑，且需将场景按楼层分割，导致丢失如楼梯等跨层结构所需的全局空间上下文。

Method: 提出名为HouseLayout3D的真实世界多楼层3D布局估计基准，并设计了一个无需训练的基线方法MultiFloor3D，该方法结合了近期的场景理解技术。

Result: MultiFloor3D在HouseLayout3D基准及先前数据集上的表现均优于当前的3D布局估计模型。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了现有方法在全建筑尺度布局估计任务中的不足，强调了该方向亟需进一步研究，并通过新基准和基线方法为未来工作奠定基础。

Abstract: Current 3D layout estimation models are primarily trained on synthetic datasets containing simple single room or single floor environments. As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为See-Think-Learn（STL）的自训练框架，通过结构化推理模板引导视觉语言模型先提取视觉属性再进行推理，并结合正负推理理由进行自训练，从而在不依赖昂贵标注数据的情况下同时提升感知与推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多模态推理中受限于感知或推理能力的不足，而增强推理的方法通常依赖高质量的思维链（CoT）数据，这些数据获取成本高或忽略感知环节。

Method: 提出See-Think-Learn（STL）自训练框架：1）采用结构化推理模板，使模型先以文本形式提取视觉属性，再基于这些属性进行推理；2）在自训练循环中让模型生成并学习自身的结构化推理理由；3）引入负向推理理由（解释错误选项的原因）以增强模型区分正确与误导性答案的能力。

Result: 在多个领域的实验表明，STL优于仅使用答案或自生成推理进行训练的基线方法，定性分析也验证了其生成的推理理由质量较高。

Conclusion: STL是一种高效且低成本的方法，能有效提升视觉语言模型的多模态推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种参数高效的音视频联合去噪架构 AVFullDiT，利用预训练的文本到视频（T2V）和文本到音频（T2A）模块进行联合训练。实验表明，即使仅关注视频质量，音视频联合去噪也能提升视频生成效果，尤其在包含大幅运动和物体接触的复杂场景中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索音视频联合去噪训练是否能在仅关注视频质量的情况下提升视频生成效果，并验证音频信号是否可作为视觉事件因果关系的辅助监督信号。

Method: 引入 AVFullDiT 架构，结合预训练 T2V 与 T2A 模块进行音视频联合去噪训练；同时训练一个仅使用 T2V 的对照模型，在相同设置下比较性能。

Result: 音视频联合训练不仅提升了音视频同步性，还在视频生成质量上取得一致提升，特别是在具有大幅运动和物体接触的挑战性子集上效果显著。

Conclusion: 音频预测作为一种特权信号，有助于模型学习视觉事件与其声学后果之间的因果关系，从而正则化视频动态；跨模态协同训练是构建更强、更具物理真实感世界模型的有效路径。

Abstract: Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的序列化具身探索与推理基准SEER-Bench，并在此基础上设计了3DSPMR方法，通过融合关系、视觉和几何信息增强多模态大语言模型在连续具身任务中的空间记忆与推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有具身智能研究多聚焦于单任务场景，而现实应用中智能体常需处理连续子任务，其中部分任务可能不可行（如寻找不存在的物体），且需复用先前探索所积累的空间知识以支持后续推理与探索。这一更具挑战性且实际意义重大的问题尚未被充分研究。

Method: 作者构建了SEER-Bench基准，涵盖序列化具身问答（EQA）与多模态导航（EMN）任务；并提出3DSPMR方法，利用已探索区域的关系、视觉及几何线索，增强多模态大语言模型的空间理解与推理能力。

Conclusion: 该工作首次将几何信息显式融入基于多模态大语言模型的空间推理中，在序列化具身任务中展现出优越性能，为未来具身智能研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为轨迹引导数据集蒸馏（TGDD）的新方法，通过在模型训练轨迹上动态对齐特征分布并引入分布约束正则化，提升了合成数据的语义多样性和代表性，在多个数据集上达到领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于分布匹配（DM）的数据集蒸馏方法忽略了训练过程中特征表示的演化，导致合成数据表达能力受限、下游任务性能下降。

Method: 将分布匹配重构为沿模型训练轨迹的动态对齐过程，在每个训练阶段对齐原始与合成数据的特征分布，并引入分布约束正则化以减少类别重叠。

Result: 在十个数据集上的实验表明，TGDD在不增加优化开销的情况下实现了SOTA性能，尤其在高分辨率基准上准确率提升达5.0%。

Conclusion: TGDD有效提升了合成数据的质量与下游任务表现，在性能与效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了WorldPack，一种具有高效压缩记忆机制的视频世界模型，通过轨迹打包和记忆检索，在较短上下文长度下显著提升了长期生成的空间一致性、保真度和质量，并在Minecraft的LoopNav基准上优于当前最先进的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期、时空一致的视频世界建模是一个长期未解决的问题，即使是最新的先进模型也因处理长上下文输入时计算成本过高而难以实现。

Method: 提出WorldPack模型，其核心是高效的压缩记忆机制，包括轨迹打包（trajectory packing）以提高上下文效率，以及记忆检索（memory retrieval）以维持 rollout 中的一致性并支持需要空间推理的长期生成。

Result: 在专为评估长期一致性设计的Minecraft LoopNav基准上，WorldPack显著优于当前最先进的模型。

Conclusion: WorldPack通过引入压缩记忆机制，在降低上下文长度的同时有效提升了视频世界模型在长期生成中的空间一致性与生成质量，为高效长期世界建模提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Video world models have attracted significant attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity future visual observations conditioned on past observations and navigation actions. Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: G-SHARP 是一个基于 GSplat 的实时手术场景重建框架，专为微创手术中可变形组织的快速高精度 3D 建模而设计，具有商业兼容性，并已在 NVIDIA 边缘硬件上部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的内窥镜重建方法多依赖非商业衍生版本，限制了其在临床环境中的部署；因此需要一个既实时又具备商业兼容性的手术重建方案。

Method: G-SHARP 首次在手术重建流程中原生集成 Apache-2.0 许可的 GSplat 可微分高斯光栅化器，实现原则性的形变建模、鲁棒遮挡处理，并在 EndoNeRF pulling 基准上进行高保真重建。

Conclusion: G-SHARP 提供了一个高效、可部署且商业兼容的实时手术场景重建解决方案，推动了高斯泼溅技术在临床环境中的实际应用。

Abstract: We propose G-SHARP, a commercially compatible, real-time surgical scene reconstruction framework designed for minimally invasive procedures that require fast and accurate 3D modeling of deformable tissue. While recent Gaussian splatting approaches have advanced real-time endoscopic reconstruction, existing implementations often depend on non-commercial derivatives, limiting deployability. G-SHARP overcomes these constraints by being the first surgical pipeline built natively on the GSplat (Apache-2.0) differentiable Gaussian rasterizer, enabling principled deformation modeling, robust occlusion handling, and high-fidelity reconstructions on the EndoNeRF pulling benchmark. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with strong speed-accuracy trade-offs suitable for intra-operative use. Finally, we provide a Holoscan SDK application that deploys G-SHARP on NVIDIA IGX Orin and Thor edge hardware, enabling real-time surgical visualization in practical operating-room settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出UCAgents，一种受临床多学科团队（MDT）工作流程启发的分层多智能体框架，通过结构化证据审计和单向收敛机制，在医学视觉问答任务中显著提升准确率并大幅降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学诊断中存在“推理脱节”问题，即生成的语言解释虽流畅但偏离图像证据；而当前多智能体框架虽试图缓解单一模型偏见，却因开放式讨论引入更多文本噪声、计算成本高，且未能有效锚定视觉证据。

Method: UCAgents采用分层多智能体架构，禁止智能体改变立场，仅允许其进行有针对性的证据验证，并引入一轮问询式讨论以识别图文不一致风险。该方法通过信息论形式化了视觉模糊性与文本噪声构成的“双噪声瓶颈”，从而约束推理过程。

Result: 在四个医学VQA基准上实验表明，UCAgents在PathVQA上达到71.3%的准确率，比当前最优方法高出6.0%，同时减少87.7%的token消耗，有效平衡了视觉证据挖掘与文本干扰抑制。

Conclusion: UCAgents在保证诊断可靠性的同时显著提升计算效率，展现出在真实临床场景中部署的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, yet suffer from reasoning detachment, where linguistically fluent explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出3D-SLIM，一种针对3D场景语言理解的新型注意力掩码策略，通过引入几何自适应和指令感知机制，克服传统因果掩码在3D任务中的局限性，在不增加模型参数或结构改动的前提下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D场景语言理解中直接使用语言模型的标准因果注意力掩码，导致对无序3D对象产生顺序偏见，并限制了对象与指令之间的交互，阻碍了任务导向的推理能力。

Method: 提出3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask（3D-SLIM），包含两个核心组件：基于空间密度而非token顺序的Geometry-adaptive Mask，以及允许对象token直接访问指令上下文的Instruction-aware Mask。

Result: 在多个3D场景-语言任务基准和不同大语言模型基线上，3D-SLIM均带来显著性能提升，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 3D-SLIM通过改进解码器注意力机制，有效适配3D多模态推理需求，表明解码器设计在3D场景语言理解中具有关键作用。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: While diffusion model for audio-driven avatar video generation have achieved notable process in synthesizing long sequences with natural audio-visual synchronization and identity consistency, the generation of music-performance videos with camera motions remains largely unexplored. We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了在平移和旋转下部分到部分点集配准中特征向量不变性的问题，指出基于深度学习和高斯混合模型（如DeepGMR）的方法存在理论与实践局限，并提出一种基于注意力机制的参考点偏移（ARPS）层来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习和高斯混合模型的点集配准方法（如DeepGMR）在处理部分到部分配准时存在对变换不鲁棒、无法有效提取不变特征的问题，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出一种注意力机制驱动的参考点偏移（ARPS）层，通过注意力模块识别两个部分点集的公共参考点，从而获得对平移和旋转变换具有不变性的特征表示。

Result: 引入ARPS层后，DeepGMR及其变体UGMMReg的配准性能显著提升，并优于其他使用注意力机制或Transformer提取重叠区域或参考点的深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前深度学习与GMM结合方法在部分到部分配准中的不足，并通过ARPS层提供了一种有效且可解释的解决方案，为未来相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the invariance of feature vectors for partial-to-partial point set registration under translation and rotation of input point sets, particularly in the realm of techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points. We believe these findings provide deeper insights into registration methods using deep learning and GMMs.

Abstract: Document Layout Parsing serves as a critical gateway for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to access and interpret the world's vast stores of structured knowledge. This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training. In this paper, we introduce dots.ocr, a single Vision-Language Model that, for the first time, demonstrates the advantages of jointly learning three core tasks within a unified, end-to-end framework. This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains. The efficacy of our unified paradigm is validated by state-of-the-art performance on the comprehensive OmniDocBench. Furthermore, to catalyze research in global document intelligence, we introduce XDocParse, a challenging new benchmark spanning 126 languages. On this testbed, dots.ocr establishes a powerful new baseline, outperforming the next-best competitor by a remarkable +7.4 point margin and proving its unparalleled multilingual capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出GeoDiT，一种面向地理空间领域的扩散式视觉-语言模型，通过并行细化机制取代自回归模型的顺序生成方式，在结构化输出任务上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型与地理空间理解固有的并行特性不匹配，强制采用顺序叙事方式，限制了结构化、连贯输出的生成能力。

Method: 将地理空间生成重构为并行细化过程，采用由粗到细的整体合成策略，并提出首个面向地理空间领域的扩散式视觉-语言模型GeoDiT。

Result: GeoDiT在需要结构化、以对象为中心输出的基准测试中达到新的SOTA水平，在图像描述、视觉定位和多目标检测等任务上显著优于自回归模型。

Conclusion: 使生成过程与数据内在结构对齐，是提升复杂地理空间分析性能的关键。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are structurally misaligned with the inherently parallel nature of geospatial understanding, forcing a rigid sequential narrative onto scenes and fundamentally hindering the generation of structured and coherent outputs. We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiT establishes a new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs. It achieves significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection, precisely the tasks where autoregressive models falter. Our work validates that aligning the generative process with the data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis.

Motivation: 单图像超分辨率（SISR）仍是计算机视觉中的难题，现有方法在性能和泛化能力方面仍有提升空间。作者旨在探索自监督预训练与Vision Transformer结合在图像超分辨率任务中的潜力。

Method: 提出ViT-SR方法：首先在着色任务上对ViT进行自监督预训练以学习通用视觉表征，然后将预训练模型微调用于4倍超分辨率；通过预测高频残差图像加到双三次插值结果上，简化残差学习过程。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练能有效提升Vision Transformer在图像超分辨率任务中的表现，未来可通过更大ViT架构或不同预训练任务进一步优化性能。

Abstract: In computer vision, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is still a difficult problem. We present ViT-SR, a new technique to improve the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) employing a two-stage training strategy. In our method, the model learns rich, generalizable visual representations from the data itself through a self-supervised pretraining phase on a colourization task. The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our two-stage approach and highlight the potential of self-supervised pre-training for complex image restoration tasks. Further improvements may be possible with larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks.

Abstract: The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) aim to detect anomalous samples and regions without any training data, a capability increasingly crucial in industrial inspection and medical imaging. This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.
  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.
  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.
  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.
  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.

Conclusion: 所提方法成功提升了多模态大语言模型在持续学习场景下的任务泛化能力，为高效桥接VLM与扩散模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has highlighted the challenge of efficiently bridging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Diffusion Models. While methods using a fixed number of learnable query tokens offer computational efficiency, they suffer from task generalization collapse, failing to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks. To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning. Additionally, we introduce a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details. Experimental results confirm our approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) suffers from a lack of large-scale high-quality training data due to challenges in data privacy and annotation costs. While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.

Conclusion: 通过保留局部语义并构建多层次对齐数据，Panel2Patch 有效解决了现有方法忽略细粒度对应的问题，为生物医学视觉-语言模型提供了更高效的数据利用方式。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in developing strong biomedical vision-language models. A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.

Abstract: Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.

Conclusion: 将自适应纹理映射融入高斯泼溅可有效提升外观细节表达效率，在保持高质量渲染的同时显著降低模型复杂度。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become the method of choice for 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of captured real scenes. However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.
  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RULER-Bench，一个用于评估视频生成模型基于认知规则的推理能力的新基准，涵盖40项任务、六大规则类别和622个高质量标注实例，并通过GPT-o3实现与人类判断85%一致性的自动评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型的评估主要关注视觉感知和理解方面（如美学、指令遵循、时序一致性），但对其基于规则的推理能力缺乏细粒度分解和系统性评估。

Method: 构建RULER-Bench基准，基于文本到视频和图像到视频两种范式，设计覆盖六类认知规则的40项任务；为每个生成视频制定包含四项指标的检查清单，并利用GPT-o3进行评分。

Result: 在RULER-Bench上，当前最先进的视频生成模型在规则一致性指标上仅达到48.87%，表明其推理能力仍有显著提升空间。

Conclusion: RULER-Bench为视频生成模型的推理能力提供了系统评估框架，有望推动具备推理意识的视频生成技术发展，助力迈向视觉基础智能。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of videos with strong temporal consistency and impressive visual quality, marking a crucial step toward vision foundation models. To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence.

*Shuonan Yang,Tailin Chen,Jiangbei Yue,Guangliang Cheng,Jianbo Jiao,Zeyu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RAMF的多模态融合框架，通过局部-全局上下文融合和语义交叉注意力机制提升对仇恨视频内容的理解，并引入对抗推理机制增强模型对细微仇恨意图的识别能力，在两个真实数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频中的仇恨言论日益严重，而现有方法难以有效融合多模态间的复杂语义关系，且缺乏对细微仇恨内容的理解能力。

Method: 提出Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion（RAMF）框架，包含Local-Global Context Fusion（LGCF）和Semantic Cross Attention（SCA）以实现多模态细粒度交互；并引入对抗推理机制，通过视觉语言模型生成客观描述、假设为仇恨与非仇恨的推断，以丰富上下文理解。

Result: 在两个真实世界的仇恨视频数据集上，该方法在Macro-F1和仇恨类召回率上分别比当前最优方法提升了3%和7%。

Conclusion: 所提出的RAMF框架能有效提升对多模态仇恨视频内容的识别能力，具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Hate speech in online videos is posing an increasingly serious threat to digital platforms, especially as video content becomes increasingly multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.

*Mohamed Awad,Mahmoud Akrm,Walid Gomaa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，对抗训练虽然提升了模型自身的鲁棒性，却意外增强了其生成的对抗样本的可迁移性，从而带来新的生态系统风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究较少关注对抗训练对攻击可迁移性的影响，而这一影响可能带来潜在的安全隐患。

Method: 作者训练了包含CNN和ViT在内的36个多样化模型，并对其生成的对抗样本进行了全面的可迁移性实验。

Result: 实验结果揭示了一个悖论：对抗训练模型生成的扰动比标准模型更具可迁移性。

Conclusion: 对抗训练可能无意中增加对抗样本的可迁移性，因此在评估模型鲁棒性时，应同时考虑其抵抗迁移攻击的能力及其产生可迁移攻击的倾向。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.

*Yifan Li,Yingda Yin,Lingting Zhu,Weikai Chen,Shengju Qian,Xin Wang,Yanwei Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVSeg提出了一种基于显式分解的视频对象分割方法，通过在预训练视觉语言模型中执行语义解释、时序证据选择和空间定位三步推理，并结合强化学习优化推理链，在标准基准上达到领先性能并提供可解释的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将复杂的动态、因果和时序交互因素简化为隐式嵌入中的推理，导致推理过程不透明且难以处理，因此需要一种更明确、可解释的推理机制。

Method: ReVSeg采用显式分解策略，在预训练视觉语言模型的原生接口中执行三步顺序推理操作：语义解释、时序证据选择和空间定位，并利用强化学习优化多步推理链。

Result: ReVSeg在标准视频对象分割基准上取得了最先进的性能，并生成了可解释的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过显式分解推理过程并与预训练模型能力对齐，ReVSeg不仅提升了分割性能，还增强了模型的可解释性，为复杂视频理解任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Abstract: We introduce PoreTrack3D, the first benchmark for dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting in pore-scale, non-rigid 3D facial trajectory tracking. It contains over 440,000 facial trajectories in total, among which more than 52,000 are longer than 10 frames, including 68 manually reviewed trajectories that span the entire 150 frames. To the best of our knowledge, PoreTrack3D is the first benchmark dataset to capture both traditional facial landmarks and pore-scale keypoints trajectory, advancing the study of fine-grained facial expressions through the analysis of subtle skin-surface motion. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting methods on PoreTrack3D, establishing the first performance baseline in this domain. Overall, the pipeline developed for this benchmark dataset's creation establishes a new framework for high-fidelity facial motion capture and dynamic 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的多分辨率检索-检测（MRD）框架，通过融合不同分辨率下的语义相似性图并结合开放词汇目标检测模型，有效提升多模态大语言模型对高分辨率图像的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像裁剪的方法在处理高分辨率图像时容易将完整目标分割到多个裁剪块中，破坏语义相似性计算；同时不同尺寸的目标在不同分辨率下表现更佳，需针对性处理。

Method: 提出多分辨率语义融合方法，整合不同分辨率下获得的语义相似性图以保留目标完整性；并引入基于滑动窗口的开放词汇目标检测（OVD）模型，实现全局尺度上的目标直接定位。

Result: 在多个高分辨率图像理解基准上使用不同多模态大语言模型进行实验，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MRD框架无需训练即可显著提升多模态大语言模型对高分辨率图像的理解性能，有效缓解因目标碎片化导致的语义偏差问题。

Abstract: Understanding high-resolution images remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Junwon Lee,Juhan Nam,Jiyoung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SelVA，一种新型文本条件视频到音频生成模型，能根据文本提示从多对象视频中选择性地生成用户指定的声音，解决了现有方法因视觉特征纠缠而无法精准分离音源的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多媒体制作中，需对每个声音源单独处理音频轨道以实现精确编辑与创意控制，但当前视频到音频生成方法通常一次性生成混合音频，难以按用户意图分离特定声源。

Method: SelVA模型将文本提示作为目标声源的显式选择器，调制视频编码器以提取与提示相关的视频特征；通过引入补充token抑制无关激活，增强跨注意力机制，并采用自增强策略缓解单声道音频监督数据不足的问题。

Result: 在VGG-MONOAUDIO基准上的大量实验表明，SelVA在音频质量、语义对齐和时序同步方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: SelVA有效实现了文本引导下的选择性视频到音频生成，为多媒体内容创作提供了更精细的音频控制能力。

Abstract: This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为EGGS的混合高斯泼溅方法，结合2D和3D高斯表示，在新视角合成中兼顾外观保真度与几何精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）虽能实现实时高质量渲染，但存在多视角不一致问题；而2D高斯泼溅（2DGS）虽保证一致性却损失纹理细节。为平衡两者优势，作者提出新方法。

Method: 提出Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting（EGGS），包含混合高斯光栅化、自适应类型交换机制和频率解耦优化策略，并通过CUDA加速实现高效训练与推理。

Result: 大量实验表明，EGGS在渲染质量、几何精度和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EGGS为高质量新视角合成提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案，有效融合了2D与3D高斯表示的优势。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is crucial in computer vision and graphics, with wide applications in AR, VR, and autonomous driving. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with high appearance fidelity, it suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, limiting geometric accuracy. In contrast, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) enforces multi-view consistency but compromises texture details. To address these limitations, we propose Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS), a hybrid representation that integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians to balance appearance and geometry. To achieve this, we introduce Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization that effectively exploits the strengths of each type of Gaussian representation. Our CUDA-accelerated implementation ensures efficient training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality NVS.

### [59] [Spatially-Grounded Document Retrieval via Patch-to-Region Relevance Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02660)
*Agathoklis Georgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种混合架构Snappy，结合视觉语言模型（如ColPali）的细粒度图像相似性与OCR提取的文本区域坐标，在无需额外训练的情况下，实现更精确的文档检索，适用于检索增强生成（RAG）任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型虽能实现高质量文档检索，但仅返回整页内容，缺乏精确定位；而OCR系统虽提供带坐标的文本结构，却缺乏语义相关性判断能力。二者各有局限，难以满足RAG对精准上下文的需求。

Method: 提出一种混合架构：利用ColPali在图像块级别计算的查询-视觉相似度作为空间相关性过滤器，作用于OCR提取的文本区域；形式化定义了视觉Transformer图像块网格与OCR边界框之间的坐标映射关系，并引入交集度量以传播相关性，同时给出检索精度的理论边界。

Result: 所提方法可在推理阶段直接应用，无需额外训练；作者发布了开源实现Snappy，实证评估正在进行中。

Conclusion: 该混合方法有效融合了视觉语义与OCR结构信息，在保持高效的同时提升了检索的定位精度，为RAG等需要细粒度上下文的任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成基准主要基于物理常识，难以深入评估模型在真实科学规律下的零样本推理能力；因此需要一个能衡量模型是否具备本科生水平科学理解能力的新基准。

Method: 构建包含200个精心设计提示的VideoScience-Bench基准，覆盖物理与化学的14个主题；通过专家标注，在T2V和I2V设置下从五个维度评估七个先进视频模型，并采用VLM-as-a-Judge方法自动评分。

Result: 实验表明VLM-as-a-Judge的评估结果与人类判断高度一致，且当前视频模型在科学现象建模方面仍存在明显不足。

Conclusion: VideoScience-Bench是首个将视频模型视为推理者而非仅生成器的评估基准，强调其输出需体现对科学规律的理解，为未来视频生成模型的发展提供新方向。

Abstract: The next frontier for video generation lies in developing models capable of zero-shot reasoning, where understanding real-world scientific laws is crucial for accurate physical outcome modeling under diverse conditions. However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

*Derui Shan,Qian Qiao,Hao Lu,Tao Du,Peng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PolarGuide-GSDR，首次将偏振先验嵌入3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）优化中，通过偏振与3DGS之间的双向耦合机制，在无需环境贴图或强材质假设的前提下，实现高保真反射分离与全场景重建，并保持实时渲染能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏振感知NeRF方法在镜面反射场景中存在训练慢、渲染效率低及对材质/视角假设依赖强的问题；而3DGS虽支持实时渲染，却难以准确重建反射，且引入延迟反射模块会依赖环境贴图。因此，亟需一种兼顾高保真反射建模与实时性能的新方法。

Method: 提出PolarGuide-GSDR框架，建立偏振与3DGS之间的双向耦合机制：首先利用3DGS的几何先验解决偏振歧义，再用优化后的偏振信息指导3DGS的法线与球谐表示优化，从而实现无需环境贴图的反射分离与场景重建。

Result: 在公开与自采数据集上验证了该方法在镜面反射重建、法线估计和新视角合成方面达到SOTA性能，同时保持实时渲染能力。

Conclusion: PolarGuide-GSDR是首个将偏振先验直接嵌入3DGS优化的框架，在复杂反射场景建模中兼具优越的可解释性与实时性能。

Abstract: Polarization-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable novel view synthesis of specular-reflection scenes but face challenges in slow training, inefficient rendering, and strong dependencies on material/viewpoint assumptions. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Anti-UAV跟踪方法缺乏统一的跨模态协作框架，多采用独立模型处理不同模态，忽视了跨模态信息共享潜力，且多模态融合效果不佳。

Method: 提出UAUTrack框架，采用单流、单阶段、端到端架构整合RGB、TIR等多模态数据，并引入文本先验提示策略引导模型聚焦于无人机目标。

Result: 在Anti-UAV和DUT Anti-UAV数据集上达到最先进性能，在Anti-UAV410数据集上兼顾精度与速度，展现高准确率和实用效率。

Conclusion: UAUTrack有效解决了Anti-UAV跟踪中多模态融合与跨模态协作的挑战，为实际应用提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Research in Anti-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking has explored various modalities, including RGB, TIR, and RGB-T fusion. However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为FASA的两阶段框架，通过显式分离前景与背景并引入伪掩码引导，提升了无监督场景分解和目标发现的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于槽注意力的方法在处理视觉场景时对前景和背景不加区分，导致背景干扰和在真实数据上实例发现性能不佳。

Method: FASA采用两阶段策略：第一阶段通过双槽竞争机制粗略分解场景以区分前景与背景，槽由聚类初始化；第二阶段引入掩码槽注意力机制，其中第一个槽捕获背景，其余槽竞争表示前景对象，并利用自监督图像特征构建的块亲和图生成伪掩码以缓解前景过分割。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，FASA在场景分解和对象一致性表示方面优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 显式建模前景区域并结合伪掩码引导能有效提升无监督对象中心表示学习的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in object-centric representation learning have shown that slot attention-based methods can effectively decompose visual scenes into object slot representations without supervision. However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation. Code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有异常分割方法依赖合成数据缓解真实异常样本稀缺问题，但这些合成数据常缺乏上下文一致性和物理真实性，导致与真实数据存在域差距，限制模型在开放世界中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出ClimaDrive框架，结合结构引导的多天气图像生成与提示驱动的异常区域修复，生成语义一致、天气多样且物理合理的异常驾驶场景；基于此构建包含六种典型驾驶场景和多种天气条件的大规模基准ClimaOoD。

Conclusion: ClimaOoD提供了高质量、多样化的训练数据，有效增强了模型对开放世界中未知异常的检测鲁棒性与泛化能力。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation seeks to detect and localize unknown or out-of-distribution (OoD) objects that fall outside predefined semantic classes a capability essential for safe autonomous driving. However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF. These results demonstrate that ClimaOoD enhances model robustness, offering valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection.

*Zixuan Song,Jing Zhang,Di Wang,Zidie Zhou,Wenbin Liu,Haonan Guo,En Wang,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出GeoBridge，一种支持跨视图双向匹配和语言-图像检索的地理定位基础模型，并构建了大规模多视图、跨模态对齐数据集GeoLoc。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卫星中心范式在高分辨率或最新卫星图像不可用时鲁棒性受限，且未能充分利用跨视图（如无人机、卫星、街景）和跨模态（如语言与图像）的互补信息。

Method: 提出GeoBridge模型，采用新颖的语义锚点机制，通过文本描述桥接多视图特征，实现鲁棒灵活的地理定位；同时构建包含5万+多视图图像及文本描述的GeoLoc数据集用于训练与评估。

Result: 实验表明，基于GeoLoc预训练的GeoBridge显著提升了地理定位准确率，并增强了跨域泛化与跨模态知识迁移能力。

Conclusion: GeoBridge通过语义锚点机制有效整合多视图与多模态信息，突破了传统卫星中心范式的局限，为跨视图地理定位提供了更鲁棒、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization infers a location by retrieving geo-tagged reference images that visually correspond to a query image. However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks. Experiments confirm that GeoLoc pre-training markedly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer. The dataset, source code, and pretrained models were released at https://github.com/MiliLab/GeoBridge.

*Zhenkai Wu,Xiaowen Ma,Zhenliang Ni,Dengming Zhang,Han Shu,Xin Jiang,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的视觉语言模型（VLM）视觉令牌剪枝方法 VLM-Pruner，在高达88.9%的剪枝率下仍优于现有基线方法，并显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM剪枝方法要么仅考虑令牌重要性而忽略冗余，要么在处理冗余时忽视空间关系，导致保留的令牌过于稀疏、无法充分覆盖目标物体区域。

Method: 提出VLM-Pruner算法，包含离心式令牌剪枝范式（由近及远选择并优先保留细粒度细节）、空间稀疏缓冲（BSS）准则（延迟选择空间距离较远的令牌）、并行贪心策略高效选令牌，以及将被剪除令牌中的显著信息融合回保留令牌以减少信息损失。

Result: 在五种VLM上以88.9%的剪枝率一致优于强基线方法，并实现端到端推理加速。

Conclusion: VLM-Pruner通过显式平衡冗余性和空间稀疏性，有效提升了高剪枝率下的模型性能与推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于性别分层的全身MRI图像配准方法，通过结合皮下脂肪和肌肉掩膜提升配准精度，在UK Biobank数据上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为实现UK Biobank全身MRI图像的空间标准化及与非影像健康数据（如组织体积、脂肪含量）的体素级关联分析，需开发鲁棒且精确的受试者间图像配准方法。

Method: 采用VIBESegmentator生成的皮下脂肪和肌肉掩膜，增强基于强度的图割配准方法，并按性别分层进行全身MRI图像配准。

Result: 在4000名受试者子集上，该方法男性/女性平均Dice分数达0.77/0.75，较仅用强度的方法提升6个百分点，较uniGradICON和MIRTK分别提升9/8和12/13个百分点；年龄与脂肪含量/组织体积的相关性图谱更清晰、解剖对齐更好。

Conclusion: 结合两种组织掩膜的配准方法显著提升了UK Biobank全身MRI图像的配准效果，有利于医学研究中的体素级分析。

Abstract: The UK Biobank is a large-scale study collecting whole-body MR imaging and non-imaging health data. Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content).
  We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research.
  The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment.
  In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images.

TL;DR: 本文提出GeoViS框架，通过树状结构的渐进式视觉搜索与推理机制，有效提升遥感图像中细粒度视觉定位的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法在遥感图像中面临目标极小、场景尺度大以及查询涉及复杂地理空间关系等挑战，难以直接迁移通用多模态大模型的能力。

Method: GeoViS将遥感视觉定位重构为一个渐进式的搜索与推理过程，利用树状结构的视觉线索序列，结合多模态感知、空间推理和奖励引导的探索策略，迭代优化地理空间假设。

Result: 在五个遥感定位基准上的实验表明，GeoViS在关键指标上持续优于现有方法，展现出优异的跨域泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: GeoViS通过引入奖励引导的渐进式搜索机制，有效解决了遥感图像中细粒度目标定位的难题，显著提升了模型的地理空间理解能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models(MLLMs) have led to remarkable progress in visual grounding, enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual queries and image regions. However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有基于图像的无人机定位方法依赖大量配对的无人机-卫星图像进行训练，但这类数据获取成本高且难以获得，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 采用仅使用卫星参考图像进行训练的新范式，通过专门设计的数据增强策略模拟卫星视图与真实无人机视图之间的视觉域偏移，并提出高效模型CAEVL来实现该范式。

Result: 在新发布的ViLD真实世界无人机图像数据集上验证了所提方法，其性能与使用配对数据训练的方法具有竞争力，显示出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的CAEVL方法有效解决了训练阶段对配对无人机图像的依赖问题，在无配对数据条件下实现了高性能的图像定位，具备强泛化能力。

Abstract: Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is critical for UAV autonomy. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities.

### [70] [AttMetNet: Attention-Enhanced Deep Neural Network for Methane Plume Detection in Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02751)
*Rakib Ahsan,MD Sadik Hossain Shanto,Md Sultanul Arifin,Tanzima Hashem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AttMetNet的新型注意力增强深度学习框架，用于利用Sentinel-2卫星影像进行甲烷羽流检测。该方法融合了归一化差分甲烷指数（NDMI）与注意力增强U-Net，在抑制背景噪声的同时强化甲烷吸收特征，并采用焦点损失应对类别不平衡问题，在真实数据集上实现了优于现有方法的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确检测甲烷排放对减缓全球变暖至关重要，但现有方法在Sentinel-2影像中易受背景变化和地表覆盖多样性影响，产生大量误报；传统方法依赖波段差异或比值，需专家验证，而现有深度学习方法缺乏对甲烷特异性特征的关注机制。

Method: AttMetNet结合NDMI与注意力增强U-Net架构，通过注意力机制选择性增强甲烷吸收特征并抑制背景干扰，同时使用焦点损失函数处理正样本稀少及像素稀疏带来的类别不平衡问题，并在真实甲烷羽流数据集上进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，AttMetNet在甲烷羽流检测任务中优于现有方法，具有更低的误报率、更优的精确率-召回率平衡以及更高的交并比（IoU）。

Conclusion: AttMetNet是一种专为真实卫星影像中鲁棒甲烷羽流检测设计的新型架构，通过融合物理先验（NDMI）与注意力机制显著提升了检测准确性与实用性。

Abstract: Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.

### [71] [TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789)
*Tang Haonan,Chen Yanjun,Jiang Lezhi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出TrackNetV5，通过引入运动方向解耦（MDD）模块和残差驱动时空精炼（R-STR）头，在保持实时推理能力的同时显著提升了对遮挡下高速小目标的跟踪精度，达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TrackNet系列在处理遮挡和运动方向模糊问题上存在局限：V1-V3仅依赖视觉线索难以应对遮挡，而V4虽引入运动信息但因使用绝对差分法丢失了运动极性，导致方向歧义。

Method: TrackNetV5整合两个新机制：1）运动方向解耦（MDD）模块，将时序动态分解为带符号的极性场，显式编码运动发生与轨迹方向；2）基于Transformer的残差驱动时空精炼（R-STR）头，采用由粗到精策略，利用分解的时空上下文估计校正残差以恢复被遮挡目标。

Result: 在TrackNetV2数据集上，TrackNetV5取得F1分数0.9859和准确率0.9733的新SOTA结果，相比V4仅增加3.7% FLOPs，仍保持实时推理能力。

Conclusion: TrackNetV5有效解决了先前版本在遮挡和方向模糊方面的不足，在几乎不增加计算负担的前提下显著提升了跟踪性能，为高速小目标跟踪提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源与闭源多模态图像编辑模型之间的性能差距不断扩大，主要受限于缺乏大规模、高质量的训练数据和能够全面诊断模型在多样化编辑行为中弱点的综合评测基准。现有数据构建方法在规模与质量之间存在权衡：人工标注质量高但不可扩展，自动化流程则易受错误传播和噪声影响。

Method: 作者设计了一个轻量级数据流水线，用端到端模型替代多工具链，并引入统一的后验证阶段；同时训练了一个7B参数的双任务专家模型Qwen-Verify，用于高效检测失败案例和重写指令，从而构建包含1000万样本的UnicEdit-10M数据集。此外，提出了UnicBench评测基准，涵盖空间推理与知识驱动型编辑任务，并引入Non-edit Consistency和Reasoning Accuracy等新评估指标。

Result: 该方法成功构建了大规模高质量数据集UnicEdit-10M，并通过UnicBench对主流模型进行了系统评估，揭示了现有模型在复杂编辑任务中的局限性，为未来研究提供了明确方向。

Conclusion: 通过轻量级数据构建流程与新型评测基准，本文有效缓解了图像编辑领域高质量数据稀缺的问题，并为多模态模型的能力评估与改进提供了有力工具和清晰路径。

Abstract: With the rapid advances of powerful multimodal models such as GPT-4o, Nano Banana, and Seedream 4.0 in Image Editing, the performance gap between closed-source and open-source models is widening, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks capable of diagnosing model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors. Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks. We also propose \textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. To enable fine-grained diagnosis, we introduce novel metrics, including \textit{Non-edit Consistency} and \textit{Reasoning Accuracy}. Our analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了视频与文本模态在信息密度上的差异，导致修改主体指代模糊和细节语义关注不足，从而影响CVR性能。

Method: 提出Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network（HUD），包含整体代词消歧、原子级不确定性建模和整体到原子对齐三个组件，通过跨模态交互实现对象消歧与细粒度语义对齐。

Result: HUD在三个CVR和CIR基准数据集上均达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模视频与文本模态的信息密度差异，HUD有效提升了多模态组合查询的理解能力，显著增强了CVR与CIR任务的检索精度。

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) is a challenging video retrieval task that utilizes multi-modal queries, consisting of a reference video and modification text, to retrieve the desired target video. The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks. The codes are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/HUD.github.io/.

TL;DR: 本文提出IC-World，一种基于大视频模型的新型生成框架，通过激活其上下文内生成能力并结合强化学习与新设计的奖励机制，在共享世界建模任务中实现多视角视频的并行生成，并在几何和运动一致性方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏对“共享世界建模”问题的系统研究，即从一组输入图像生成代表同一底层世界但不同相机视角的多个视频，需确保场景几何和物体运动的一致性。

Method: 提出IC-World框架，利用大视频模型的上下文内生成能力实现并行生成，并通过名为Group Relative Policy Optimization的强化学习方法及两个新设计的奖励模型（分别用于场景级几何一致性和物体级运动一致性）进行微调。

Result: 大量实验表明，IC-World在几何一致性和运动一致性方面显著优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: IC-World是首个系统探索基于视频的世界模型在共享世界建模任务中的工作，有效提升了多视角视频生成的一致性表现。

Abstract: Video-based world models have recently garnered increasing attention for their ability to synthesize diverse and dynamic visual environments. In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models. We further finetune IC-World via reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, together with two proposed novel reward models to enforce scene-level geometry consistency and object-level motion consistency among the set of generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore the shared world modeling problem with video-based world models.

*Fan Wu,Cheng Chen,Zhoujie Fu,Jiacheng Wei,Yi Xu,Deheng Ye,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PhyCustom，一种用于扩散模型的微调框架，通过引入两个新颖的正则化损失（等距损失和解耦损失），使模型能够更准确地理解和生成与物理概念一致的图像，在物理定制任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的文本到图像定制方法在处理具体概念（如风格、形状）方面表现良好，但在涉及物理概念（如质量、密度、材料属性等）的定制上效果不佳，主要原因是训练过程中缺乏显式的物理知识引入，导致即使提示词包含物理相关词汇，生成结果也无法准确反映相应物理特性。

Method: 提出PhyCustom框架，包含两个新设计的正则化损失：等距损失（isometric loss）用于激活扩散模型对物理概念的学习能力；解耦损失（decouple loss）用于减少不同独立概念之间的混杂学习，从而提升物理属性的准确表达。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验表明，PhyCustom在物理定制任务中无论在定量指标还是定性视觉效果上均优于当前主流和最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过显式引入物理知识并设计针对性的正则化损失，PhyCustom有效提升了扩散模型在物理概念定制方面的性能，为文本到图像生成中更复杂的语义控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods have achieved significant success in understanding concrete concepts to control generation processes, such as styles and shapes. However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.

### [76] [Are Detectors Fair to Indian IP-AIGC? A Cross-Generator Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02850)
*Vishal Dubey,Pallavi Tyagi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统研究了针对印度及南亚人群的身份保留生成式AI（IP-AIGC）图像的检测鲁棒性与公平性，发现现有检测器在微调后虽在训练域内表现优异，但在未见过的IP-AIGC数据上性能显著下降，揭示了对身份保留编辑的特异性脆弱性，并呼吁构建更具代表性的印度相关基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AIGC检测器在身份保留生成内容（IP-AIGC）场景下的鲁棒性与公平性尚不明确，尤其对印度等代表性不足人群缺乏研究。作者旨在填补这一空白，评估现有方法在跨生成器和特定人群中的泛化能力。

Method: 作者从FairFD和HAV-DF数据集中构建面向印度人群的训练子集，并利用Gemini和ChatGPT等商用工具生成两个新的IP-AIGC测试集（HIDF-img-ip-genai和HIDF-vid-ip-genai）。随后在预训练（PT）和微调（FT）两种设置下，使用AIDE和Effort两种先进检测器进行评估，指标包括AUC、AP、EER和准确率。

Result: 微调显著提升了模型在训练域内的性能（如Effort在HAV-DF-test上的AUC从0.739升至0.944），但导致在印度人群的IP-AIGC测试集上性能大幅下降（如AIDE在HIDF-img-ip-genai上的AUC从0.923降至0.563），表明模型过度拟合了训练生成器的特征。而在非IP的HIDF图像上，预训练模型仍保持高性能，说明问题特异性地源于身份保留编辑。

Conclusion: 该研究确立了“IP-AIGC-Indian”作为一个具有挑战性且实际相关的检测场景，揭示了现有方法在此类任务中的泛化缺陷，并建议通过保留身份表征的适应方法和构建印度人群感知的基准数据集来弥合性能差距。

Abstract: Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scanning (IOS) are essential for digital dentistry, but annotated data scarcity limits automated solutions for pulp canal segmentation and cross-modal registration. To benchmark semi-supervised learning (SSL) in this domain, we organized the STSR 2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025, featuring two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth and pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在线强化学习（RL）后训练框架，通过引入可验证的几何奖励机制，显著提升了预训练视频生成模型在摄像机控制方面的精度与一致性，优于传统的监督微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型在摄像机控制视频生成方面主要依赖监督微调（SFT），而在线强化学习（RL）后训练尚未被充分探索。作者旨在填补这一空白，提升摄像机控制的精确性和生成视频的几何一致性。

Method: 设计了一个可验证的几何奖励函数：通过估计生成视频与参考视频的3D摄像机轨迹，将其划分为短片段并计算片段间的相对姿态，以此构建密集的段级对齐得分作为奖励信号，用于指导在线RL优化。同时构建了一个包含大振幅摄像机运动和多样化主体动态场景的数据集。

Conclusion: 在线强化学习结合几何奖励机制能有效提升摄像机控制视频生成的性能，为该领域提供了一种优于传统监督微调的新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have remarkably improved camera-controlled video generation, but most methods rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.

It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment. MindGPT-4ov provides a general post-training paradigm applicable to a wide range of MLLMs. The model weights, datasets, and code for the Qwen3-VL-based variants will be recently open-sourced to support the community's development of MLLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽在图像生成方面表现优异，但其推理步骤多、计算成本高，限制了实际部署。现有少步蒸馏方法常因重训练成本高和泛化能力下降而受限。

Method: 提出相位感知加速策略：对早期语义阶段采用较小加速，对后期冗余阶段采用较大加速；通过在基础模型上添加两个轻量级LoRA适配器（分别用于慢速和快速去噪阶段）实现高效加速，避免大规模重训练。

Result: 在多个基准上实现最高5倍的加速，同时保持与原模型相当的视觉质量；仅用1个样本在单张V100上训练1小时，即可获得在未见提示上具有良好泛化能力的模型。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过轻量级LoRA适配器实现了高效、低资源消耗且泛化能力强的扩散模型加速，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.

Method: 提出DiverseAR：（1）引入自适应logits分布缩放机制，动态调节二值输出分布的锐度以实现更平滑的预测；（2）设计基于能量的生成路径搜索算法，避免采样低置信度token以维持高保真度。

Result: 大量实验表明，DiverseAR显著提升了比特级自回归图像生成模型的样本多样性，同时保持了良好的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过缓解比特级AR模型中由预测空间受限和logits分布过锐引起的多样性不足问题，DiverseAR为高质量、高多样性图像生成提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underexplored challenge of sample diversity in autoregressive (AR) generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers. We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.

Conclusion: LoVoRA 有效解决了现有方法对辅助信息的依赖，在无需掩码条件下实现了高保真、时空一致的文本引导视频编辑。

Abstract: Text-guided video editing, particularly for object removal and addition, remains a challenging task due to the need for precise spatial and temporal consistency. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits. The core innovation of LoVoRA is its learnable object-aware localization mechanism, which provides dense spatio-temporal supervision for both object insertion and removal tasks. By leveraging a Diffusion Mask Predictor, LoVoRA achieves end-to-end video editing without requiring external control signals during inference. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and high-quality performance of LoVoRA.

Conclusion: Layout Anything 在保证几何准确性的前提下实现了高效的端到端布局估计，适用于增强现实和大规模三维场景重建等实际应用。

Abstract: We present Layout Anything, a transformer-based framework for indoor layout estimation that adapts the OneFormer's universal segmentation architecture to geometric structure prediction. Our approach integrates OneFormer's task-conditioned queries and contrastive learning with two key modules: (1) a layout degeneration strategy that augments training data while preserving Manhattan-world constraints through topology-aware transformations, and (2) differentiable geometric losses that directly enforce planar consistency and sharp boundary predictions during training. By unifying these components in an end-to-end framework, the model eliminates complex post-processing pipelines while achieving high-speed inference at 114ms. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, with pixel error (PE) of 5.43% and corner error (CE) of 4.02% on the LSUN, PE of 7.04% (CE 5.17%) on the Hedau and PE of 4.03% (CE 3.15%) on the Matterport3D-Layout datasets. The framework's combination of geometric awareness and computational efficiency makes it particularly suitable for augmented reality applications and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: 以LiDAR为中心、将图像特征作为隐式引导的融合策略，能有效解决多模态3D目标检测中的空间错位与语义稀疏问题，显著提升检测性能与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion. The source code is available at https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation.

Motivation: 现有针对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的越狱攻击主要聚焦于文本-图像交互，将视觉模态视为次要提示，未能充分利用图像承载复杂上下文信息的潜力。

Method: 提出Contextual Image Attack (CIA)方法，采用多智能体系统，通过四种可视化策略将有害查询嵌入良性视觉上下文中，并引入上下文元素增强和自动毒性混淆技术以提升攻击效果。

Result: 在MMSafetyBench-tiny数据集上，CIA对GPT-4o和Qwen2.5-VL-72B的毒性得分分别达4.73和4.83，攻击成功率（ASR）分别为86.31%和91.07%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 视觉模态本身是越狱先进多模态大语言模型的有效载体，所提出的CIA方法有效揭示了当前MLLM安全对齐机制在图像输入方面的脆弱性。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their safety alignments are susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\% and 91.07\%. Our method significantly outperforms prior work, demonstrating that the visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs.

Conclusion: InEx是一种有效的、无需训练的多智能体框架，能够显著缓解MLLM中的幻觉问题，具有良好的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge in large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of reliable multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U4D is an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling that improves realism and temporal stability by generating scenes in a “hard-to-easy” manner guided by spatial uncertainty maps and enhanced with a spatio-temporal fusion block.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative methods for 4D LiDAR modeling treat all spatial regions uniformly, ignoring varying scene uncertainty, which causes artifacts in complex or ambiguous areas and harms realism and temporal consistency.

Method: U4D estimates spatial uncertainty using a pretrained segmentation model, then performs two-stage generation: (1) detailed reconstruction of high-uncertainty regions, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion of the rest using structural priors. A mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block ensures temporal coherence during diffusion.

Result: Experiments show U4D generates geometrically accurate and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, outperforming existing methods in 4D world modeling for autonomous driving and simulation.

Conclusion: By explicitly modeling spatial uncertainty and leveraging a hard-to-easy generation strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, U4D significantly enhances the fidelity and reliability of 4D LiDAR world modeling.

Abstract: Modeling dynamic 3D environments from LiDAR sequences is central to building reliable 4D worlds for autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly accelerating the development of autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS), paving the way for the Internet of Agents. However, traditional centralized MAS architectures present significant challenges, including single points of failure, vulnerability to censorship, inherent scalability limitations, and critical trust issues. We propose a novel Decentralized Multi-Agent System (DMAS) architecture designed to overcome these fundamental problems by enabling trust-aware, scalable, and censorship-resistant interactions among autonomous agents. Our DMAS features a decentralized agent runtime underpinned by a blockchain-based architecture. We formalize a trust-aware communication protocol that leverages cryptographic primitives and on-chain operations to provide security properties: verifiable interaction cycles, communication integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation, and conditional confidentiality, which we further substantiate through a comprehensive security analysis. Our performance analysis validates the DMAS as a scalable and efficient solution for building trustworthy multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: EZYer 有效解决了当前教育工具在课件生成、互动笔记和内容质量方面的不足，通过多模块协同与严格的内容控制机制，实现了高质量、高互动性的智能教育辅助，具有实际推广价值。

Abstract: With the rapid development of the online education and large language model, the existing educational tools still suffer from incomplete service, insufficient performance and weak interactivity in terms of courseware generation, interactive notes and quality assurance of content. In particular, the proposed generative agent EZYer : 1) Teacher Module: Integrating the Text Corpus retrieval and in-depth generation technologies, it automatically generates structured teaching materials and LaTeX Beamer courseware in line with the high school mathematics syllabus and supports user-defined image insertion. 2) Student Module: Throughout the collaborative interaction of the four roles of Teacher, Assistant, Top Student and Struggling Student, Note Taker summarizes and generates academic notes to enhance the depth and interest of learning. 3) Controller: set up keyword filtering system, content scoring system, role co-validation system, and dynamic content correction system. This ensure academic strictness and pedagogical propriety of EZYer inputs and outputs. In order to evaluate EZYer, this paper designs five-dimensional evaluation indexes of content accuracy, knowledge coverage, usability, formatting correctness and visual design and appeal, and scores 100 Beamer and Notes generated by EZYer by five large language models, separately, and the results show that the quality of EZYer-generated content is excellent and has a good application prospect.

### [91] [Beyond Single-Agent Safety: A Taxonomy of Risks in LLM-to-LLM Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02682)
*Piercosma Bisconti,Marcello Galisai,Federico Pierucci,Marcantonio Bracale,Matteo Prandi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 当前针对人与大语言模型（LLM）交互设计的安全机制在多LLM相互作用的环境中失效，因为它们仅关注单个模型的行为控制，而忽视了系统层面的交互风险。本文提出从模型级安全转向系统级安全，并引入“涌现系统性风险视界”（ESRH）框架来解释风险如何源于交互结构，同时提出一种名为InstitutionalAI的新型多智能体监督架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全机制假设模型在单一用户监督下运行，但现实中LLM越来越多地在彼此交互的生态系统中运作，导致局部合规可能引发整体系统性失败，因此需要新的系统级安全范式。

Method: 提出“涌现系统性风险视界”（ESRH）理论框架，构建微-中-宏观三层失效模式分类法，并设计InstitutionalAI架构以在多智能体系统中嵌入自适应监督机制。

Result: 阐明了多LLM交互中集体风险的产生机制，建立了系统性失效的分类体系，并提出了可行的系统级安全架构方案。

Conclusion: 保障多LLM系统的安全需超越个体对齐，转向关注交互结构带来的系统性风险，并通过制度化、自适应的监督机制实现系统级安全。

Abstract: This paper examines why safety mechanisms designed for human-model interaction do not scale to environments where large language models (LLMs) interact with each other. Most current governance practices still rely on single-agent safety containment, prompts, fine-tuning, and moderation layers that constrain individual model behavior but leave the dynamics of multi-model interaction ungoverned. These mechanisms assume a dyadic setting: one model responding to one user under stable oversight. Yet research and industrial development are rapidly shifting toward LLM-to-LLM ecosystems, where outputs are recursively reused as inputs across chains of agents. In such systems, local compliance can aggregate into collective failure even when every model is individually aligned. We propose a conceptual transition from model-level safety to system-level safety, introducing the framework of the Emergent Systemic Risk Horizon (ESRH) to formalize how instability arises from interaction structure rather than from isolated misbehavior. The paper contributes (i) a theoretical account of collective risk in interacting LLMs, (ii) a taxonomy connecting micro, meso, and macro-level failure modes, and (iii) a design proposal for InstitutionalAI, an architecture for embedding adaptive oversight within multi-agent systems.

*PIerre Dantas,Lucas Cordeiro,Youcheng Sun,Waldir Junior*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了LLM-验证器收敛定理，通过将大语言模型与形式化验证工具的交互建模为离散时间马尔可夫链，首次为LLM辅助软件验证提供了可证明的终止性与收敛性保证，并通过超过9万次实验验证了理论预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型（LLM）与形式化验证工具结合的方法缺乏坚实的理论基础，导致验证过程不可靠，可能出现循环、发散或无法收敛的问题，亟需建立具有形式化保证的收敛框架。

Method: 作者将LLM与验证器的交互过程建模为离散时间马尔可夫链，引入错误减少概率δ作为关键参数，提出LLM-验证器收敛定理，并通过90,000多次实验对理论预测进行压力测试。

Result: 所有实验均成功达到验证状态，收敛因子C_f≈1.0，实证结果与理论高度一致；期望迭代次数上界为𝔼[n] ≤ 4/δ；据此划分出边际、实用和高性能三个工作区域，并确立了明确的设计阈值。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM辅助的形式化验证提供了首个具备可证明终止性和收敛性的理论框架，使系统不再依赖启发式调优，支持在安全关键软件环境中进行可预测的资源规划与性能预算。

Abstract: The idea of using Formal Verification tools with large language models (LLMs) has enabled scaling software verification beyond manual workflows. However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($δ$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $δ> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\mathbb{E}[n] \leq 4/δ$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification. Heuristic tuning no longer has to be carried out by the system. Engineers gain a framework that supports predictable resource planning and performance budgeting, precisely what is needed before deploying these pipelines into safety-critical software environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: \textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid} 是一个轻量级网页系统，利用视觉-语言模型将流程图图像转换为可编辑的 Mermaid.js 代码，并支持多种交互式编辑方式，同时提出新指标评估转换质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程图常以静态图像形式共享，难以编辑和复用；现有图像转图表工具缺乏结构化、可版本控制的文本表示。

Method: 使用详细的系统提示和视觉-语言模型将流程图图像转换为 Mermaid.js 代码，并通过内联文本编辑、拖放节点插入和自然语言指令实现混合主动式精调。

Result: 系统生成与渲染图同步的结构化文本表示，并引入评估指标衡量结构准确性、流程正确性、语法有效性和完整性。

Conclusion: \textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid} 提供了一种高效、可编辑且可版本控制的流程图图像转代码方案，优于现有图像到图表的转换工具。

Abstract: Flowcharts are common tools for communicating processes but are often shared as static images that cannot be easily edited or reused. We present \textsc{Flowchart2Mermaid}, a lightweight web system that converts flowchart images into editable Mermaid.js code which is a markup language for visual workflows, using a detailed system prompt and vision-language models. The interface supports mixed-initiative refinement through inline text editing, drag-and-drop node insertion, and natural-language commands interpreted by an integrated AI assistant. Unlike prior image-to-diagram tools, our approach produces a structured, version-controllable textual representation that remains synchronized with the rendered diagram. We further introduce evaluation metrics to assess structural accuracy, flow correctness, syntax validity, and completeness across multiple models.

*Pengju Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IACT 是一种基于用户对话驱动的通用自主智能体系统，通过动态构建递归智能体拓扑结构并采用双向状态化对话机制，解决了传统静态工作流在灵活性和错误传播方面的局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统智能体工作流依赖预定义图结构或专用编程，缺乏对开放性任务的适应能力，且单向函数调用易导致错误传播；IACT 旨在通过对话驱动的动态组织结构克服这些限制。

Method: IACT 以用户对话为唯一输入，根据高层目标自主增量式生成递归智能体拓扑，并以双向、有状态的对话替代刚性调用，实现运行时错误纠正与歧义消解。

Result: 在 kragent.ai 系统中成功部署 IACT，通过真实工作流展示了其在处理复杂、开放式任务中的有效性，提供了定性证据而非全面基准测试。

Conclusion: IACT 提供了一种灵活、可扩展且具备容错能力的智能体协作范式，适用于需要动态组织结构的开放性任务场景。

Abstract: This technical white paper introduces the Interactive Agents Call Tree (IACT), a computational model designed to address the limitations of static, hard-coded agent workflows. Unlike traditional systems that require pre-defined graphs or specialized programming, IACT operates as a general-purpose autonomous system driven purely by user dialogue. Given a high-level objective, the system autonomously grows a dynamic, recursive agent topology incrementally tailored to the problem's structure. This allows it to scale its organizational complexity to match open-ended tasks. To mitigate the error propagation inherent in unidirectional function calls, IACT introduces interactional redundancy by replacing rigid invocations with bidirectional, stateful dialogues. This mechanism enables runtime error correction and ambiguity resolution. We describe the architecture, design principles, and practical lessons behind the production deployment of this model in the kragent.ai system, presenting qualitative evidence from real-world workflows rather than exhaustive benchmark results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将复杂世界模型（以转换器表示）分解为模块化子模型的框架，使得子模型可在不同输入-输出子空间上并行运行，从而提升计算效率与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界模型通常计算开销大，而真实场景往往具有模块化交互的子组件结构；因此，有必要开发一种能利用这种模块性的高效建模方法。

Method: 作者构建了一个框架，用于将由转换器（transducers）表示的复杂世界模型进行分解，推导出作用于独立输入-输出子空间的子转换器。

Result: 该方法实现了对单体式世界模型的并行化和可解释替代方案，支持分布式推理，并连接了AI安全所需的结构透明性与实际推理所需的计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为实现既安全又高效的AI系统提供了理论基础，通过模块化分解提升了世界模型的可扩展性与可解释性。

Abstract: World models have been recently proposed as sandbox environments in which AI agents can be trained and evaluated before deployment. Although realistic world models often have high computational demands, efficient modelling is usually possible by exploiting the fact that real-world scenarios tend to involve subcomponents that interact in a modular manner. In this paper, we explore this idea by developing a framework for decomposing complex world models represented by transducers, a class of models generalising POMDPs. Whereas the composition of transducers is well understood, our results clarify how to invert this process, deriving sub-transducers operating on distinct input-output subspaces, enabling parallelizable and interpretable alternatives to monolithic world modelling that can support distributed inference. Overall, these results lay a groundwork for bridging the structural transparency demanded by AI safety and the computational efficiency required for real-world inference.

*Shubhi Asthana,Bing Zhang,Chad DeLuca,Ruchi Mahindru,Hima Patel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STRIDE是一个用于评估任务是否需要使用自主智能体的框架，通过结构化分析任务特性，在直接调用大语言模型、引导式AI助手和完全自主智能体之间做出最优选择，从而降低成本与复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型向目标驱动的自主智能体演进，如何判断何时真正需要使用智能体成为关键问题。盲目部署智能体会带来更高的成本、复杂性和风险，因此需要一个系统化的方法来指导部署决策。

Method: 提出STRIDE框架，结合结构化任务分解、动态性归因和自省需求分析，计算“智能体适用性评分”，据此在三种模态（直接LLM调用、引导式助手、完全自主智能体）中进行选择。

Result: 在30个真实任务中评估，STRIDE在模态选择上达到92%准确率，减少45%不必要的智能体部署，并降低37%资源成本；六个月的专家验证确认其在SRE和合规领域的实用价值。

Conclusion: 智能体的采用应基于必要性驱动的设计决策，STRIDE确保仅在任务具有内在动态性或上下文演化时才启用完全自主智能体，从而实现效益与成本的平衡。

Abstract: The rapid shift from stateless large language models (LLMs) to autonomous, goal-driven agents raises a central question: When is agentic AI truly necessary? While agents enable multi-step reasoning, persistent memory, and tool orchestration, deploying them indiscriminately leads to higher cost, complexity, and risk.
  We present STRIDE (Systematic Task Reasoning Intelligence Deployment Evaluator), a framework that provides principled recommendations for selecting between three modalities: (i) direct LLM calls, (ii) guided AI assistants, and (iii) fully autonomous agentic AI. STRIDE integrates structured task decomposition, dynamism attribution, and self-reflection requirement analysis to produce an Agentic Suitability Score, ensuring that full agentic autonomy is reserved for tasks with inherent dynamism or evolving context.
  Evaluated across 30 real-world tasks spanning SRE, compliance, and enterprise automation, STRIDE achieved 92% accuracy in modality selection, reduced unnecessary agent deployments by 45%, and cut resource costs by 37%. Expert validation over six months in SRE and compliance domains confirmed its practical utility, with domain specialists agreeing that STRIDE effectively distinguishes between tasks requiring simple LLM calls, guided assistants, or full agentic autonomy. This work reframes agent adoption as a necessity-driven design decision, ensuring autonomy is applied only when its benefits justify the costs.

TL;DR: 该论文通过构建一个面向财富管理的评估基准，研究通用大语言模型（LLM）智能体在助理级任务中的表现，发现其性能更受端到端工作流可靠性限制，而非数学推理能力，并强调自主性水平和评估方法对结果有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数字协作工具虽广泛使用，但日常流程仍常因人为错误和延迟而效率低下。为弥补这一差距，作者希望探索通用LLM智能体是否能在准确性和经济性上胜任财富管理相关任务。

Method: 研究扩展了TheAgentCompany平台，引入金融领域环境，构建包含12组任务对的基准测试集，涵盖检索、分析与综合/沟通三类任务；每项任务设有明确验收标准、确定性评分器及高/低自主性变体，并采用合成领域数据与增强的同事模拟。

Result: 实验表明，智能体的瓶颈主要在于端到端工作流的可靠性，而非数学推理能力；自主性水平显著影响任务完成效果；同时，模型评估方法不当会误导基准测试结果。

Conclusion: 要有效评估LLM智能体在财富管理助理角色中的适用性，需关注工作流整体可靠性、合理设置自主性，并采用严谨的评估机制以避免误判模型能力。

Abstract: Modern work relies on an assortment of digital collaboration tools, yet routine processes continue to suffer from human error and delay. To address this gap, this dissertation extends TheAgentCompany with a finance-focused environment and investigates whether a general purpose LLM agent can complete representative wealth-management tasks both accurately and economically. This study introduces synthetic domain data, enriches colleague simulations, and prototypes an automatic task-generation pipeline. The study aims to create and assess an evaluation set that can meaningfully measure an agent's fitness for assistant-level wealth management work. We construct a benchmark of 12 task-pairs for wealth management assistants spanning retrieval, analysis, and synthesis/communication, with explicit acceptance criteria and deterministic graders. We seeded a set of new finance-specific data and introduced a high vs. low-autonomy variant of every task. The paper concluded that agents are limited less by mathematical reasoning and more so by end-to-end workflow reliability, and meaningfully affected by autonomy level, and that incorrect evaluation of models have hindered benchmarking.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across perception, language, reasoning, and multimodal domains. Yet despite these achievements, modern AI systems remain fun- damentally limited in their ability to self-monitor, self-correct, and regulate their behavior autonomously in dynamic contexts. This paper identifies and analyzes seven core deficiencies that constrain contemporary AI models: the absence of intrinsic self- monitoring, lack of meta-cognitive awareness, fixed and non- adaptive learning mechanisms, inability to restructure goals, lack of representational maintenance, insufficient embodied feedback, and the absence of intrinsic agency. Alongside identifying these limitations, we also outline a forward-looking perspective on how AI may evolve beyond them through architectures that mirror neurocognitive principles. We argue that these structural limitations prevent current architectures, including deep learning and transformer-based systems, from achieving robust general- ization, lifelong adaptability, and real-world autonomy. Drawing on a comparative analysis of artificial systems and biological cognition [7], and integrating insights from AI research, cognitive science, and neuroscience, we outline how these capabilities are absent in current models and why scaling alone cannot resolve them. We conclude by advocating for a paradigmatic shift toward cognitively grounded AI (cognitive autonomy) capable of self-directed adaptation, dynamic representation management, and intentional, goal-oriented behavior, paired with reformative oversight mechanisms [8] that ensure autonomous systems remain interpretable, governable, and aligned with human values.

TL;DR: MERINDA is an FPGA-accelerated model recovery framework that replaces iterative NODE solvers with a parallelizable neural architecture, achieving significantly lower memory usage and faster runtime for real-time autonomous systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying Model Recovery (MR) on edge devices for mission-critical autonomous systems is challenging due to the high memory and energy demands of iterative neural ODE solvers, especially on FPGAs.

Method: The paper proposes MERINDA, a novel framework that substitutes iterative solvers in neural ODEs with a parallelizable neural architecture tailored for FPGA acceleration.

Result: MERINDA reduces DRAM usage by nearly 11x and improves runtime by 2.2x over mobile GPUs, while revealing a trade-off between memory and energy at fixed accuracy.

Conclusion: MERINDA is well-suited for resource-constrained, real-time mission-critical autonomous systems by enabling efficient, low-memory, and energy-aware model recovery on FPGAs.

Abstract: Model Recovery (MR) enables safe, explainable decision making in mission-critical autonomous systems (MCAS) by learning governing dynamical equations, but its deployment on edge devices is hindered by the iterative nature of neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), which are inefficient on FPGAs. Memory and energy consumption are the main concerns when applying MR on edge devices for real-time operation. We propose MERINDA, a novel FPGA-accelerated MR framework that replaces iterative solvers with a parallelizable neural architecture equivalent to NODEs. MERINDA achieves nearly 11x lower DRAM usage and 2.2x faster runtime compared to mobile GPUs. Experiments reveal an inverse relationship between memory and energy at fixed accuracy, highlighting MERINDA's suitability for resource-constrained, real-time MCAS.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于乳腺细胞分割的高效框架，在仅使用599张训练图像且标注极少的情况下，实现了95.5%的Dice分数。方法结合了量子启发的边缘增强、改进的损失函数、基于复杂度的加权采样策略以及EfficientNet-B7/UNet++架构，显著提升了边界精度和小病灶检测能力，大幅减少了医学专家标注所需时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注耗时且依赖专家经验，尤其在乳腺上皮细胞核数据集中，标注工作可能需数百小时。同时，图像中目标区域占比极低（0.1%-20%），存在严重的类别不平衡问题，且部分图像不含目标区域，给模型训练带来巨大挑战。

Result: 在仅599张训练图像和129张验证图像上，模型达到Dice分数95.5% ± 0.3%和IoU 91.2% ± 0.4%。其中，量子增强使边界准确率提升2.1%，加权采样使小病灶检测率提高3.8%。

Conclusion: 所提方法在极有限标注条件下实现了乳腺细胞分割的突破性性能，显著降低了医学专家在数据集创建中的时间成本，有效缓解了临床感知AI发展中标注瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Annotating medical images demands significant time and expertise, often requiring pathologists to invest hundreds of hours in labeling mammary epithelial nuclei datasets. We address this critical challenge by achieving 95.5% Dice score using just 599 training images for breast cell segmentation, where just 4% of pixels represent breast tissue and 60% of images contain no breast regions. Our framework uses quantum-inspired edge enhancement via multi-scale Gabor filters creating a fourth input channel, enhancing boundary detection where inter-annotator variations reach +/- 3 pixels. We present a stabilized multi-component loss function that integrates adaptive Dice loss with boundary-aware terms and automatic positive weighting to effectively address severe class imbalance, where mammary epithelial cell regions comprise only 0.1%-20% of the total image area. Additionally, a complexity-based weighted sampling strategy is introduced to prioritize the challenging mammary epithelial cell regions. The model employs an EfficientNet-B7/UNet++ architecture with a 4-to-3 channel projection, enabling the use of pretrained weights despite limited medical imaging data. Finally, robust validation is achieved through exponential moving averaging and statistical outlier detection, ensuring reliable performance estimates on a small validation set (129 images). Our framework achieves a Dice score of 95.5% +/- 0.3% and an IoU of 91.2% +/- 0.4%. Notably, quantum-based enhancement contributes to a 2.1% improvement in boundary accuracy, while weighted sampling increases small lesion detection by 3.8%. By achieving groundbreaking performance with limited annotations, our approach significantly reduces the medical expert time required for dataset creation, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in clinical perception AI development.

Abstract: Omni-modal Large Language Models (OLLMs) that process text, images, videos, and audio introduce new challenges for safety and value guardrails in human-AI interaction. Prior guardrail research largely targets unimodal settings and typically frames safeguarding as binary classification, which limits robustness across diverse modalities and tasks. To address this gap, we propose OmniGuard, the first family of omni-modal guardrails that performs safeguarding across all modalities with deliberate reasoning ability. To support the training of OMNIGUARD, we curate a large, comprehensive omni-modal safety dataset comprising over 210K diverse samples, with inputs that cover all modalities through both unimodal and cross-modal samples. Each sample is annotated with structured safety labels and carefully curated safety critiques from expert models through targeted distillation. Extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks show that OmniGuard achieves strong effectiveness and generalization across a wide range of multimodal safety scenarios. Importantly, OmniGuard provides a unified framework that enforces policies and mitigates risks in omni-modalities, paving the way toward building more robust and capable omnimodal safeguarding systems.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在多视角空间推理中难以保持几何一致性和跨视角一致性，主要由于缺乏能将多视角推理与单视角感知及时间因素分离的细粒度评测基准。

Method: 构建 ReMindView-Bench 基准，系统性地变化视角空间模式和查询类型以探测空间认知的关键因素；通过显式分析（如 LLM-as-a-judge 和自洽提示）和隐式分析（如线性探针和熵动态）评估15个主流 VLM 的多视角空间推理能力。

Result: 评估显示 VLMs 在帧内感知任务上表现良好，但在跨视角信息整合时性能急剧下降；隐式分析进一步揭示了任务相关信息在推理过程中逐步丢失，且正确与错误推理路径的不确定性难以区分。

Conclusion: ReMindView-Bench 为 VLM 的空间推理能力提供了基于认知科学的诊断工具，揭示了多视角空间心智模型在推理各阶段的形成、退化与不稳定机制。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core aspect of human intelligence that allows perception, inference and planning in 3D environments. However, current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle to maintain geometric coherence and cross-view consistency for spatial reasoning in multi-view settings. We attribute this gap to the lack of fine-grained benchmarks that isolate multi-view reasoning from single-view perception and temporal factors. To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories. These results provide a cognitively grounded diagnosis of VLM spatial reasoning and reveal how multi-view spatial mental models are formed, degraded and destabilized across reasoning phases. The ReMindView-Bench benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Xue0823/ReMindView-Bench, and the source codes of benchmark construction and VLM reasoning analysis are available at https://github.com/pittisl/ReMindView-Bench.

*Ran Zhang,Kun Ouyang,Tiancheng Ma,Yida Yang,Dong Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的生成式智能体MMO模拟系统，通过监督微调和强化学习将LLM适配到游戏领域，并结合数据驱动的环境模型，实现对玩家行为的高保真模拟，从而支持高效、可解释的数值与机制优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MMO游戏数值与机制优化依赖大规模在线实验或预设统计模型调参，成本高、耗时长且可能干扰玩家体验；而现有离线模拟系统保真度不足，难以准确复现真实玩家的推理与干预反应。

Method: 利用大规模真实玩家行为数据，对大语言模型进行监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），使其具备游戏特定领域的决策能力；同时基于真实游戏日志训练数据驱动的环境模型，构建动态游戏系统。

Result: 实验表明，该系统在模拟玩家行为方面与现实高度一致，并能对干预措施产生合理的因果响应。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架为MMO游戏的数值设计优化提供了一种可靠、可解释且成本效益高的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing numerical systems and mechanism design is crucial for enhancing player experience in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.

*David X. Wu,Shreyas Kapur,Anant Sahai,Stuart Russell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探索了通过监督学习结合合成错误注入来训练大语言模型的自我纠错能力，但发现该方法在多种模型和任务上效果有限，难以超越基于强化学习的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于强化学习在激发大语言模型推理与自我纠错能力方面计算成本高昂，作者希望借鉴自动驾驶和机器人领域的技术，探索更高效的替代方案。

Method: 在推理链中人工注入错误并进行掩码，然后通过监督学习训练模型识别并纠正这些合成错误。

Result: 该方法即使在简单合成任务上也未能显著提升模型性能；即便模型识别出错误，也常重复原始错误；合成错误与策略内错误之间的分布偏移严重影响纠错效果。

Conclusion: 合成错误注入的监督学习难以有效诱导模型的自我纠错能力，这解释了为何基于策略的强化学习在该任务中表现独特且有效。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the dominant paradigm for eliciting reasoning and self-correction capabilities in large language models, but its computational expense motivates exploration of alternatives. Inspired by techniques from autonomous driving and robotics, we investigate whether supervised learning with synthetic error injection can induce self-correction abilities in language models. Our approach inserts artificial errors into reasoning chains, masks them, and supervises the model to recognize and correct these mistakes. Despite the intuitive appeal of this method, we find that it fails to significantly improve performance even on simple synthetic tasks across multiple models. Moreover, even when the model catches its own error, it often parrots the original mistake. We find that the distribution shift of synthetic errors to on-policy errors significantly degrades the error-correction capabilities of the fine-tuned model, even with good synthetic coverage of on-policy errors. Our results help explain why on-policy reinforcement learning methods have proven uniquely effective for eliciting self-correction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于智能体的AI流程，利用自然语言理解对预测市场进行聚类，并识别具有强依赖关系的市场对，进而构建交易策略，在Polymarket历史数据上验证了其有效性和收益性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测市场常因问题重叠、隐含等价和隐藏矛盾而碎片化，影响效率与可操作性。作者旨在通过AI自动挖掘市场间的语义结构和结果依赖关系，提升信息整合能力并生成可执行的交易信号。

Method: 该方法包括两个步骤：(i) 利用自然语言理解和合约文本及元数据，将市场聚类为连贯的主题组；(ii) 在每个聚类内识别出结果高度相关的市场对（包括同向或反向关系）。随后将这些关系转化为简单交易策略，并在Polymarket的历史已结算市场数据上评估其准确性与收益表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，智能体识别的关系准确率约为60–70%，基于这些关系构建的交易策略在一周时间范围内平均获得约20%的回报。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于智能体的AI和大语言模型能够有效揭示预测市场中潜在的语义结构，并将其转化为具有实际收益的交易信号。

Abstract: Prediction markets allow users to trade on outcomes of real-world events, but are prone to fragmentation through overlapping questions, implicit equivalences, and hidden contradictions across markets. We present an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously (i) clusters markets into coherent topical groups using natural-language understanding over contract text and metadata, and (ii) identifies within-cluster market pairs whose resolved outcomes exhibit strong dependence, including same-outcome (correlated) and different-outcome (anti-correlated) relationships. Using a historical dataset of resolved markets on Polymarket, we evaluate the accuracy of the agent's relational predictions. We then translate discovered relationships into a simple trading strategy to quantify how these relationships map to actionable signals. Results show that agent-identified relationships achieve roughly 60-70% accuracy, and their induced trading strategies earn about 20% average returns over week-long horizons, highlighting the ability of agentic AI and large language models to uncover latent semantic structure in prediction markets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-Few 是一种结合轻量级人工监督的自博弈框架，通过引导式挑战者-求解器机制实现模型稳定、可控的自我进化，在数学和通用推理任务上显著优于无监督自进化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无引导的AI自进化系统常因概念漂移、多样性崩溃和错误进化等问题而性能停滞甚至退化，亟需一种能在减少人工监督的同时实现稳定可控自我进化的机制。

Method: 提出 R-Few 框架：挑战者（Challenger）在每次迭代中采样少量人工标注样本以指导合成问题生成；求解器（Solver）在基于难度的在线课程下联合训练人工与合成数据，并引入上下文锚定和混合训练实现轻量级人工监督。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准上，R-Few 实现持续迭代提升。例如 Qwen3-8B-Base 在数学任务上比 R-Zero 高出 3.0 分，性能媲美使用20倍人工数据训练的 General-Reasoner。消融实验证实了挑战者锚定训练与求解器课程训练的互补作用，且 R-Few 能有效缓解概念漂移。

Conclusion: R-Few 通过轻量人工引导与课程学习机制，实现了模型稳定、可控的自我进化，为减少对大规模人工标注依赖的自主智能发展提供了有效路径。

Abstract: AI self-evolution has long been envisioned as a path toward superintelligence, where models autonomously acquire, refine, and internalize knowledge from their own learning experiences. Yet in practice, unguided self-evolving systems often plateau quickly or even degrade as training progresses. These failures arise from issues such as concept drift, diversity collapse, and mis-evolution, as models reinforce their own biases and converge toward low-entropy behaviors. To enable models to self-evolve in a stable and controllable manner while minimizing reliance on human supervision, we introduce R-Few, a guided Self-Play Challenger-Solver framework that incorporates lightweight human oversight through in-context grounding and mixed training. At each iteration, the Challenger samples a small set of human-labeled examples to guide synthetic question generation, while the Solver jointly trains on human and synthetic examples under an online, difficulty-based curriculum. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Few achieves consistent and iterative improvements. For example, Qwen3-8B-Base improves by +3.0 points over R-Zero on math tasks and achieves performance on par with General-Reasoner, despite the latter being trained on 20 times more human data. Ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of grounded challenger training and curriculum-based solver training, and further analysis shows that R-Few mitigates drift, yielding more stable and controllable co-evolutionary dynamics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于链式思维（CoT）的轻量级开源大语言模型框架COPE，用于从急性缺血性卒中患者的非结构化临床记录中预测90天功能预后，其性能优于ClinicalBERT、传统机器学习模型和单步LLM，与GPT-4.1相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非结构化的临床笔记包含丰富的上下文信息，但难以被传统预测模型有效利用，因此需要一种能从这类文本中准确预测卒中患者预后的新方法。

Method: COPE采用两阶段链式思维框架，基于开源LLaMA-3-8B模型：第一阶段生成临床推理，第二阶段输出改良Rankin量表（mRS）预测。研究纳入464例急性缺血性卒中患者，比较COPE与GPT-4.1、ClinicalBERT、基于结构化变量的机器学习模型及单步LLM的性能。

Result: COPE在测试中取得MAE为1.01，±1 mRS点准确率为74.4%，精确准确率为32.8%，性能优于ClinicalBERT（MAE 1.24）、Clinical ML（MAE 1.28）和单步LLM（MAE 1.20），与GPT-4.1相当。亚组分析显示其在不同性别和年龄组中表现稳定。

Conclusion: COPE是一种轻量、可解释且保护隐私的开源框架，能够高效准确地从非结构化临床文本中预测卒中患者90天功能结局，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries. These findings demonstrate that COPE, a lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source framework, provides an accurate and practical solution for outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text.

Motivation: 当前的内容审核系统多依赖单一模型或固定流程，难以识别隐性风险且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出 Aetheria 框架，包含五个核心智能体，通过基于RAG的知识检索支持下的动态、相互说服式辩论机制，对多模态内容进行深入分析与裁决。

Result: 在新构建的 AIR-Bench 基准上实验表明，Aetheria 在整体内容安全准确性上显著优于基线，尤其在隐性风险识别方面，并能生成详细、可追溯的审核报告。

Conclusion: Aetheria 建立了一个透明且可解释的内容审核范式，显著推动了可信AI内容审核的发展。

Abstract: The exponential growth of digital content presents significant challenges for content safety. Current moderation systems, often based on single models or fixed pipelines, exhibit limitations in identifying implicit risks and providing interpretable judgment processes. To address these issues, we propose Aetheria, a multimodal interpretable content safety framework based on multi-agent debate and collaboration.Employing a collaborative architecture of five core agents, Aetheria conducts in-depth analysis and adjudication of multimodal content through a dynamic, mutually persuasive debate mechanism, which is grounded by RAG-based knowledge retrieval.Comprehensive experiments on our proposed benchmark (AIR-Bench) validate that Aetheria not only generates detailed and traceable audit reports but also demonstrates significant advantages over baselines in overall content safety accuracy, especially in the identification of implicit risks. This framework establishes a transparent and interpretable paradigm, significantly advancing the field of trustworthy AI content moderation.

Conclusion: PaperDebugger 成功实现了编辑器原生、具备智能体能力的学术写作辅助系统，为未来 LLM 与专业写作环境的深度融合提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly embedded into academic writing workflows, yet existing assistants remain external to the editor, preventing deep interaction with document state, structure, and revision history. This separation makes it impossible to support agentic, context-aware operations directly within LaTeX editors such as Overleaf. We present PaperDebugger, an in-editor, multi-agent, and plugin-based academic writing assistant that brings LLM-driven reasoning directly into the writing environment. Enabling such in-editor interaction is technically non-trivial: it requires reliable bidirectional synchronization with the editor, fine-grained version control and patching, secure state management, multi-agent scheduling, and extensible communication with external tools. PaperDebugger addresses these challenges through a Chrome-approved extension, a Kubernetes-native orchestration layer, and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) toolchain that integrates literature search, reference lookup, document scoring, and revision pipelines. Our demo showcases a fully integrated workflow, including localized edits, structured reviews, parallel agent execution, and diff-based updates, encapsulated within a minimal-intrusion user interface (UI). Early aggregated analytics demonstrate active user engagement and validate the practicality of an editor-native, agentic writing assistant.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TACDA的新域自适应方法，用于跨域剩余使用寿命（RUL）预测，通过在对抗适应过程中引入目标域重构策略和一致对齐的聚类配对策略，有效保留目标特定信息并提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的RUL预测方法通常假设训练与测试数据来自同一分布，但在实际工业场景中这一假设不成立；而现有的对抗域自适应方法忽略了目标域特有信息及退化阶段的一致性特征，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出TACDA方法：1）在对抗域自适应过程中引入目标域重构策略以保留目标特定信息；2）设计一种新的聚类与配对策略，实现相似退化阶段之间的一致对齐。

Result: 在两个不同评估指标下，TACDA方法均优于当前最先进的方法，实验验证了其优越性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的TACDA方法能有效解决跨域RUL预测中的域差异问题，在保留目标域特有信息的同时实现更准确的寿命预测。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in machinery can significantly diminish maintenance costs, enhance equipment up-time, and mitigate adverse outcomes. Data-driven RUL prediction techniques have demonstrated commendable performance. However, their efficacy often relies on the assumption that training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution or domain, which does not hold in real industrial settings. To mitigate this domain discrepancy issue, prior adversarial domain adaptation methods focused on deriving domain-invariant features. Nevertheless, they overlook target-specific information and inconsistency characteristics pertinent to the degradation stages, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel domain adaptation approach for cross-domain RUL prediction named TACDA. Specifically, we propose a target domain reconstruction strategy within the adversarial adaptation process, thereby retaining target-specific information while learning domain-invariant features. Furthermore, we develop a novel clustering and pairing strategy for consistent alignment between similar degradation stages. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate the remarkable performance of our proposed TACDA method, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches with regard to two different evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型在递归推理问题中的深度泛化能力不足问题，提出一种新的循环定位-替换管道方法，有效缓解了模型在处理训练中未见的更深递归结构时的性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽在多种任务中表现优异，但在需要处理嵌套层次结构的递归推理问题上存在显著局限。现有研究多关注长度泛化，而对深度泛化（即模型处理比训练时更深嵌套结构的能力）这一不同且未被充分探索的问题缺乏深入研究。

Method: 作者提出一种循环定位-替换（looped locate-and-replace）管道方法，将递归问题分解为可管理的子组件。该方法包含两个专用模型：一个用于识别可求解子表达式的定位器（locator），另一个用于评估这些子组件并保持整体结构的替换器（replacer）。

Result: 在布尔代数、递归算术和命题逻辑三个可控递归深度的领域中进行实验，结果表明所提方法能有效缓解模型在分布外递归深度测试时的性能衰减。

Conclusion: 标准Transformer架构因缺乏类栈行为（stack-like behavior）而难以处理超出训练深度的递归问题；所提出的分解式方法通过协同使用定位与替换模型，显著提升了模型在深度泛化方面的表现。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many tasks, yet face significant challenges when dealing with recursive reasoning problems, those requiring the resolution of nested hierarchical structures. While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.

TL;DR: 本文提出MIGR框架，通过识别情绪主导模态并据此调整推理顺序，提升多模态大语言模型在情绪理解任务中推理的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态情绪理解中存在推理漂移问题：模型过度依赖自身生成文本而非多模态证据，且解释过程易受视觉引导路径影响，导致情绪解释不一致。

Method: 引入“模态重要性”（MI）机制识别情绪主导模态，并据此重排推理序列；采用两阶段训练策略——模态对齐的监督微调与模态感知的奖励优化，引导模型生成情绪一致、因果相关且连贯的解释。

Result: 在DFEW基准上，MIGR将“预测正确但解释情绪不一致”的情况从18.10%降至7.37%，显著提升推理可靠性。

Conclusion: 从情绪主导模态启动推理能有效提升多模态情绪理解中解释的一致性与可靠性，验证了MIGR框架的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning (MIGR), a framework designed to improve the reliability of reasoning-based multimodal emotion understanding in multimodal large language models. Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有助于构建促进人类协作、激发创造力与好奇心的可解释AI系统。

Abstract: As generative models become powerful, concerns around transparency, accountability, and copyright violations have intensified. Understanding how specific training data contributes to a model's output is critical. We introduce a framework for interpreting generative outputs through the automatic construction of ontologyaligned knowledge graphs (KGs). While automatic KG construction from natural text has advanced, extracting structured and ontology-consistent representations from visual content remains challenging -- due to the richness and multi-object nature of images. Leveraging multimodal large language models (LLMs), our method extracts structured triples from images, aligned with a domain-specific ontology. By comparing the KGs of generated and training images, we can trace potential influences, enabling copyright analysis, dataset transparency, and interpretable AI. We validate our method through experiments on locally trained models via unlearning, and on large-scale models through a style-specific experiment. Our framework supports the development of AI systems that foster human collaboration, creativity and stimulate curiosity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Menta，首个专为社交媒体多任务心理健康预测优化的小型语言模型（SLM），在抑郁、压力和自杀倾向等任务上显著优于现有SLM和部分大型语言模型（LLM），并可在移动设备上实时部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在心理健康应用中展现出潜力，但其庞大的体积和计算需求限制了实际部署；而小型语言模型（SLM）在此领域的应用尚未充分探索，亟需高效、轻量且准确的解决方案用于基于社交媒体的心理健康早期检测。

Method: 作者提出Menta模型，采用LoRA微调框架，在六个心理健康分类任务上进行联合训练，结合跨数据集策略与以平衡准确率为导向的损失函数，对SLM进行专门优化。

Result: Menta在多项任务上平均比最优未微调SLM提升15.2%，在抑郁和压力分类任务上表现优于13B参数的LLM，模型体积小约3.25倍，并可在iPhone 15 Pro Max上实现实时、仅需约3GB内存的端侧部署。

Conclusion: Menta展示了小型语言模型在可扩展、隐私保护的心理健康监测中的巨大潜力，为实际应用场景提供了高效可行的技术路径。

Abstract: Mental health conditions affect hundreds of millions globally, yet early detection remains limited. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in mental health applications, their size and computational demands hinder practical deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a lightweight alternative, but their use for social media--based mental health prediction remains largely underexplored. In this study, we introduce Menta, the first optimized SLM fine-tuned specifically for multi-task mental health prediction from social media data. Menta is jointly trained across six classification tasks using a LoRA-based framework, a cross-dataset strategy, and a balanced accuracy--oriented loss. Evaluated against nine state-of-the-art SLM baselines, Menta achieves an average improvement of 15.2\% across tasks covering depression, stress, and suicidality compared with the best-performing non--fine-tuned SLMs. It also achieves higher accuracy on depression and stress classification tasks compared to 13B-parameter LLMs, while being approximately 3.25x smaller. Moreover, we demonstrate real-time, on-device deployment of Menta on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, requiring only approximately 3GB RAM. Supported by a comprehensive benchmark against existing SLMs and LLMs, Menta highlights the potential for scalable, privacy-preserving mental health monitoring.

*He Wang,Wenyilin Xiao,Songqiao Han,Hailiang Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出StockMem，一种事件-反思双层记忆框架，通过结构化新闻事件并沿横向整合与纵向追踪两个维度挖掘信息，构建时序事件知识库与因果经验反思知识库，从而提升股票价格预测的准确性与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 股票价格预测因市场波动性和对实时事件的敏感性而极具挑战；现有大语言模型在金融文本预测中受限于噪声新闻数据和文本中缺乏显式答案，通用记忆架构难以识别价格变动的关键驱动因素。

Method: 提出StockMem框架：将新闻结构化为事件，通过横向整合（每日事件融合）和纵向追踪（事件演化以提取反映市场预期差异的增量信息）构建时序事件知识库；进一步分析事件-价格动态形成因果经验的反思知识库；预测时检索类比历史场景，结合当前事件、增量数据与过往经验进行推理。

Result: 实验表明，StockMem优于现有记忆架构，在预测性能上表现更优，并通过追溯影响价格的信息链提供可解释的推理过程。

Conclusion: StockMem通过双层记忆机制有效提升了金融预测的准确性和决策透明度，为基于事件的可解释金融预测提供了新范式。

Abstract: Stock price prediction is challenging due to market volatility and its sensitivity to real-time events. While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的日记账分录测试（JETs）在税务相关账本记录中产生大量误报，且难以识别细微异常，因此需要更高效、智能的异常检测方法。

Method: 在合成和真实世界匿名账本数据上对LLaMA、Gemma等前沿大语言模型进行基准测试，并与JETs及传统机器学习基线方法进行对比。

Result: 大语言模型在异常检测任务中持续优于传统JETs和经典机器学习方法，并能生成自然语言解释，提升审计过程的可解释性。

Conclusion: 大语言模型具备在审计中辅助人类审计师的潜力，推动“AI增强审计”模式，从而加强财务数据的完整性与可靠性。

Abstract: Auditors rely on Journal Entry Tests (JETs) to detect anomalies in tax-related ledger records, but rule-based methods generate overwhelming false positives and struggle with subtle irregularities. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as anomaly detectors in double-entry bookkeeping. Benchmarking SoTA LLMs such as LLaMA and Gemma on both synthetic and real-world anonymized ledgers, we compare them against JETs and machine learning baselines. Our results show that LLMs consistently outperform traditional rule-based JETs and classical ML baselines, while also providing natural-language explanations that enhance interpretability. These results highlight the potential of \textbf{AI-augmented auditing}, where human auditors collaborate with foundation models to strengthen financial integrity.

*Przemyslaw Chojecki*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文将心理测量电池的模空间理论框架扩展到动力系统领域，提出了一种由资源参数化的智能体流，并通过生成器-验证器-更新器（GVU）算子刻画其演化。作者证明该算子在参数流形上诱导向量场，并将自改进系数 κ 表示为能力泛函沿此流的李导数。核心成果是推导出“方差不等式”——一个保证自改进稳定性的谱条件，并指出当生成与验证的联合噪声足够小时，κ > 0 成立。最后，该框架统一解释了语言自博弈、自校正和合成数据自举等方法，表明 STaR、SPIN、Reflexion、GANs 和 AlphaZero 等架构均为满足该不等式的 GVU 算子的具体实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将静态的心理测量能力评分推广至动态系统视角，以形式化描述智能体在计算资源变化下的自改进过程，并为当前多种自训练与自博弈方法提供统一的理论基础。

Method: 引入由计算资源参数化的智能体流 ν_r，定义递归的生成器-验证器-更新器（GVU）算子，在参数流形 Θ 上构建向量场；利用微分几何工具（如李导数）刻画能力泛函的演化；推导确保自改进稳定性的方差不等式；并通过拓扑实现分析现有算法是否满足该不等式。

Result: 证明 GVU 算子诱导参数流形上的向量场，自改进系数 κ 可表示为能力泛函沿该流的李导数；提出方差不等式作为 κ > 0 的充分条件；成功将 LSP、自校正、合成数据等方法统一于 GVU 框架下，并揭示 STaR、SPIN、Reflexion、GANs、AlphaZero 等架构通过不同机制（滤波、对抗判别、形式系统接地）满足该不等式。

Conclusion: 该工作为智能体自改进提供了基于微分几何与动力系统的严格数学框架，不仅形式化了能力演化的动态机制，还通过方差不等式建立了稳定性判据，从而在理论上统一了多种前沿自训练范式。

Abstract: We extend the moduli-theoretic framework of psychometric batteries to the domain of dynamical systems. While previous work established the AAI capability score as a static functional on the space of agent representations, this paper formalizes the agent as a flow $ν_r$ parameterized by computational resource $r$, governed by a recursive Generator-Verifier-Updater (GVU) operator. We prove that this operator generates a vector field on the parameter manifold $Θ$, and we identify the coefficient of self-improvement $κ$ as the Lie derivative of the capability functional along this flow.
  The central contribution of this work is the derivation of the Variance Inequality, a spectral condition that is sufficient (under mild regularity) for the stability of self-improvement. We show that a sufficient condition for $κ> 0$ is that, up to curvature and step-size effects, the combined noise of generation and verification must be small enough.
  We then apply this formalism to unify the recent literature on Language Self-Play (LSP), Self-Correction, and Synthetic Data bootstrapping. We demonstrate that architectures such as STaR, SPIN, Reflexion, GANs and AlphaZero are specific topological realizations of the GVU operator that satisfy the Variance Inequality through filtration, adversarial discrimination, or grounding in formal systems.

Motivation: 为了解决非可解释模型的解释需同时具备可理解性和对原模型忠实性的问题，作者构建了一个兼顾这两项要求的概念性解释框架。

Method: 通过计算概念干预的充分性概率来生成局部与全局解释；使用基于CelebA数据集训练的分类器构建概念验证模型，并采用具有隐式因果解释的概念词汇表提升可理解性。

Result: 展示了由该框架生成的示例解释，证明其具备清晰的概念表达能力，并讨论了确保解释忠实性的关键假设和上下文一致性要求。

Conclusion: 所提出的因果概念型XAI框架能够在保证解释可理解的同时，通过明确假设和上下文对齐来维护对原始模型的忠实性。

Abstract: This work presents a conceptual framework for causal concept-based post-hoc Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), based on the requirements that explanations for non-interpretable models should be understandable as well as faithful to the model being explained. Local and global explanations are generated by calculating the probability of sufficiency of concept interventions. Example explanations are presented, generated with a proof-of-concept model made to explain classifiers trained on the CelebA dataset. Understandability is demonstrated through a clear concept-based vocabulary, subject to an implicit causal interpretation. Fidelity is addressed by highlighting important framework assumptions, stressing that the context of explanation interpretation must align with the context of explanation generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需人工设计提示的协作智能体框架，用于自动验证和优化论文到代码的生成过程，在Paper2Code框架中集成后显著提升了代码复现的准确性和完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化论文复现框架缺乏对每一步生成结果的有效验证与优化机制，或依赖人工设计的提示进行自我修正，限制了其适应性和可扩展性。

Method: 引入两个协作智能体：验证智能体检查每步输出是否符合系统提示要求，修正智能体根据问题自动改进输出；仅利用原始系统提示实现全自动优化，无需额外人工提示。

Result: 在PaperBench Code-Dev和Paper2CodeBench数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比基线分别提升约15%的准确率和13%的完整性，并在与Self-Refine的对比中展现出更强的鲁棒性和一致性。

Conclusion: 所提出的无提示协作智能体框架有效提升了论文自动复现为代码的质量，具有良好的通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Automated paper reproduction has emerged as a promising approach to accelerate scientific research, employing multi-step workflow frameworks to systematically convert academic papers into executable code. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to verify and refine the outputs at each generation step, or rely heavily on manually designed prompts for self-refinement, which limits their adaptability and scalability. To address these limitations, we propose a prompt-free collaborative agent framework that automatically enhances the quality of paper-to-code generation. Our approach employs two collaborative agents: a verification agent that examines whether the outputs at each step satisfy the requirements specified in the corresponding system prompt, and a refinement agent that revises the outputs based on the identified issues. Unlike previous methods that require human experts to craft specific refinement prompts for each step, our framework achieves automatic verification and improvement by leveraging only the original system prompts. We integrate our collaborative agents into the Paper2Code framework and conduct comprehensive experiments on PaperBench Code-Dev and Paper2CodeBench datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and completeness of reproduced code, achieving performance gains of approximately 15\% and 13\%, respectively, compared to the baseline without our agents. Furthermore, comparative experiments against Self-Refine validate the robustness and consistency of our prompt-free approach across different datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告撰写耗时且易出错，尤其在处理三维医学影像时；同时，确保报告符合临床标准的质量控制过程繁琐但关键。现有自动化方法多聚焦于报告生成，忽视了质量控制环节，难以全面支持放射科医生。

Method: 基于大语言模型构建智能体系统Radiologist Copilot，通过自主选择和调度多种工具（如病灶区域定位、结合图像的区域分析规划、模板化报告生成、质量评估及反馈驱动的自适应优化）来模拟放射科医生完成完整的报告流程。

Conclusion: Radiologist Copilot通过整合报告生成与质量控制，有效辅助放射科医生，提升临床工作效率，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Radiology reporting is an essential yet time-consuming and error-prone task for radiologists in clinical examinations, especially for volumetric medical images. Rigorous quality control is also critical but tedious, ensuring that the final report meets clinical standards. Existing automated approaches, including radiology report generation methods and medical vision-language models, focus mainly on the report generation phase and neglect the crucial quality control procedure, limiting their capability to provide comprehensive support to radiologists. We propose Radiologist Copilot, an agentic AI assistant equipped with orchestrated tools designed for automated radiology reporting with quality control. Leveraging large language models as the reasoning backbone, the agentic system autonomously selects tools, plans, and executes actions, emulating the behavior of radiologists throughout the holistic radiology reporting process. The orchestrated tools include region localization, think with image paradigm directed region analysis planning, strategic template selection for report generation, quality assessment and feedback-driven adaptive refinement for quality control. Therefore, Radiologist Copilot facilitates accurate, complete, and efficient radiology reporting, assisting radiologists and improving clinical efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Radiologist Copilot significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in radiology reporting. The source code will be released upon acceptance.

*Lucas Meijer,Arnaud de Mesmay,Tillmann Miltzow,Marcus Schaefer,Jack Stade*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的复杂性类 $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$，并证明了多个“恶魔博弈”问题（如 Packing Game、Planar Extension Game 和 Order Type Game）在该类中是完全的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具有连续选项和交替回合结构的博弈问题的计算复杂性，并引入一个适用于实数域一阶理论的自然复杂性类 $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$。

Method: 通过将语言归约到实数域一阶真理论（FOTR）来定义 $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$，并利用实图灵机等价刻画；随后构造多项式时间归约，证明多个博弈问题是 $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-完全的。

Result: 证明了 FOTRINV、Packing Game、Planar Extension Game 和 Order Type Game 均为 $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-完全问题。

Conclusion: $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$ 是刻画连续博弈问题复杂性的合适框架，且所研究的多个几何与组合博弈问题在该类中具有完全性。

Abstract: We introduce the complexity class Quantified Reals ($\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$). Let FOTR be the set of true sentences in the first-order theory of the reals. A language $L$ is in $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$, if there is a polynomial time reduction from $L$ to FOTR. This seems the first time this complexity class is studied. We show that $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$ can also be defined using real Turing machines. It is known that deciding FOTR requires at least exponential time unconditionally [Berman, 1980].
  We focus on devil's games with two defining properties: (1) Players (human and devil) alternate turns and (2) each turn has a continuum of options.
  First, we show that FOTRINV is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. FOTRINV has only inversion and addition constraints and all variables are in a compact interval. FOTRINV is a stepping stone for further reductions.
  Second, we show that the Packing Game is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. In the Packing Game we are given a container and two sets of pieces. One set of pieces for the human and one set for the devil. The human and the devil alternate by placing a piece into the container. Both rotations and translations are allowed. The first player that cannot place a piece loses.
  Third, we show that the Planar Extension Game is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. We are given a partially drawn plane graph and the human and the devil alternate by placing vertices and the corresponding edges in a straight-line manner. The vertices and edges to be placed are prescribed before hand. The first player that cannot place a vertex loses.
  Finally, we show that the Order Type Game is $\text{Q}\mathbb{R}$-complete. We are given an order-type together with a linear order. The human and the devil alternate in placing a point in the Euclidean plane following the linear order. The first player that cannot place a point correctly loses.
