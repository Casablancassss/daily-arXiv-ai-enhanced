### [1] [Saddle-Free Guidance: Improved On-Manifold Sampling without Labels or Additional Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21863)
*Eric Yeats,Darryl Hannan,Wilson Fearn,Timothy Doster,Henry Kvinge,Scott Mahan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为“无鞍点引导”（Saddle-Free Guidance, SFG）的新方法，利用对数密度估计在鞍点区域的正曲率信息来引导基于得分的生成模型，无需额外训练或标签数据，在保持计算成本与CFG相当的同时，显著提升了生成图像的多样性和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有引导方法如Classifier-Free Guidance（CFG）依赖标签数据和额外训练一个无条件模型，而Auto-Guidance则需训练较小版本模型；这些限制使得在缺乏标签数据或无法训练新模型时难以有效引导生成过程。作者发现对数密度估计在鞍点区域的正曲率可提供强引导信号，从而启发了无需额外训练或标签的SFG方法。

Method: 提出Saddle-Free Guidance（SFG），通过估计对数密度的最大正曲率来引导单个基于得分的模型，无需额外训练、不依赖标签数据，适用于现成的扩散模型和流匹配模型。

Result: 在ImageNet-512无条件生成任务中，SFG在FID和FD-DINOv2指标上达到单模型SOTA；与Auto-Guidance结合后，在FD-DINOv2上实现整体SOTA；在FLUX.1-dev和Stable Diffusion v3.5上的实验表明，SFG相比CFG能提升输出多样性，同时保持良好的提示遵循能力和图像保真度。

Conclusion: SFG是一种高效、无需额外训练或标签的引导方法，能显著提升基于得分模型的生成质量与多样性，具有广泛适用性和实用价值。

Abstract: Score-based generative models require guidance in order to generate plausible, on-manifold samples. The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.
  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score. Our experiments with FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 indicate that SFG boosts the diversity of output images compared to CFG while maintaining excellent prompt adherence and image fidelity.

### [2] [UniArt: Unified 3D Representation for Generating 3D Articulated Objects with Open-Set Articulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21887)
*Bu Jin,Weize Li,Songen Gu,Yupeng Zheng,Yuhang Zheng,Zhengyi Zhou,Yao Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniArt is a diffusion-based framework that synthesizes fully articulated 3D objects from a single image in an end-to-end manner, achieving state-of-the-art results in mesh quality and articulation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually constructing articulated 3D assets is costly and hard to scale, necessitating an automated method for realistic simulation and embodied robotics.

Method: UniArt uses a diffusion model with a unified latent representation encoding geometry, texture, part segmentation, and kinematic parameters. It introduces a reversible joint-to-voxel embedding and treats articulation type prediction as an open-set problem.

Result: Experiments on PartNet-Mobility show UniArt achieves state-of-the-art performance in both mesh quality and articulation accuracy.

Conclusion: UniArt effectively enables end-to-end synthesis of articulated 3D objects from images, generalizing well to novel joint types and object categories.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects play a vital role in realistic simulation and embodied robotics, yet manually constructing such assets remains costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we present UniArt, a diffusion-based framework that directly synthesizes fully articulated 3D objects from a single image in an end-to-end manner. Unlike prior multi-stage techniques, UniArt establishes a unified latent representation that jointly encodes geometry, texture, part segmentation, and kinematic parameters. We introduce a reversible joint-to-voxel embedding, which spatially aligns articulation features with volumetric geometry, enabling the model to learn coherent motion behaviors alongside structural formation. Furthermore, we formulate articulation type prediction as an open-set problem, removing the need for fixed joint semantics and allowing generalization to novel joint categories and unseen object types. Experiments on the PartNet-Mobility benchmark demonstrate that UniArt achieves state-of-the-art mesh quality and articulation accuracy.

### [3] [PathReasoning: A multimodal reasoning agent for query-based ROI navigation on whole-slide images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21902)
*Kunpeng Zhang,Hanwen Xu,Sheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PathReasoning，一种多模态推理智能体，通过模拟病理学家的采样、推理与自省过程，在全切片图像（WSI）中高效定位与临床问题相关的诊断区域，无需密集像素级标注即可显著提升ROI选择和报告生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像（WSI）虽能全面呈现肿瘤微环境，但其超大尺寸（可达百亿像素）使得人工或传统方法难以高效定位对临床诊断、预后和治疗响应具有关键意义的区域。现有方法在导航效率和任务导向性方面存在不足。

Method: PathReasoning是一种多轮迭代的多模态推理智能体：从随机采样的候选区域出发，通过自省机制评估当前选择，结合视觉观察与临床问题进行推理，并提出新的探索区域；在多轮交互中构建可解释的推理链，逐步聚焦于诊断相关区域，将整张WSI转化为一系列问题引导的视图序列。

Result: 在亚型分类和纵向分析任务上，PathReasoning的AUROC分别比强基线方法高出6.7%和3.1%；在乳腺癌报告生成任务中，其准确率比标准GPT-4o高10%。

Conclusion: PathReasoning能高效、准确地定位任务相关的高价值区域，生成可解释的推理路径，支持数字病理中的快速阅片、一致诊断、全面报告和证据追溯，显著提升WSI分析的临床实用性。

Abstract: Deciphering tumor microenvironment from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is intriguing as it is key to cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response. While these gigapixel images on one hand offer a comprehensive portrait of cancer, on the other hand, the extremely large size, as much as more than 10 billion pixels, make it challenging and time-consuming to navigate to corresponding regions to support diverse clinical inspection. Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed "PathReasoning", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations. PathReasoning can substantially outperform strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% of AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs further support accurate report generation on breast cancer, significantly outperforming the standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy. PathReasoning prioritizes question-specific regions and constructs interpretable reasoning chains, supporting efficient slide review, consistent diagnostic interpretations, comprehensive reporting, and evidence traceability in digital pathology.

*Yupei Zhang,Yating Huang,Wanming Hu,Lequan Yu,Hujun Yin,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种灵活的多模态原型框架，用于整合全切片图像与不完整的基因组数据，以提升精准肿瘤学中的表征与融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理组织学与基因组学多模态数据时，受限于表型与基因型异质性，并且难以应对临床中基因组数据缺失或不可用的现实场景。

Method: 该方法包含四个关键组件：1）基于文本提示和原型加权的生物原型构建；2）样本级与分布级的多视图对齐；3）用于捕捉共享与模态特异性信息的二分融合机制；4）语义基因组插补以处理缺失数据。

Result: 在多个下游任务上的大量实验表明，所提方法在性能上持续优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多模态数据异质性和缺失问题，为精准肿瘤学提供了更具鲁棒性和实用性的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal approaches that integrate histology and genomics hold strong potential for precision oncology. However, phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity limits the quality of intra-modal representations and hinders effective inter-modal integration. Furthermore, most existing methods overlook real-world clinical scenarios where genomics may be partially missing or entirely unavailable. We propose a flexible multimodal prototyping framework to integrate whole slide images and incomplete genomics for precision oncology. Our approach has four key components: 1) Biological Prototyping using text prompting and prototype-wise weighting; 2) Multiview Alignment through sample- and distribution-wise alignments; 3) Bipartite Fusion to capture both shared and modality-specific information for multimodal fusion; and 4) Semantic Genomics Imputation to handle missing data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art approaches on multiple downstream tasks.

### [5] [AmodalGen3D: Generative Amodal 3D Object Reconstruction from Sparse Unposed Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21945)
*Junwei Zhou,Yu-Wing Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AmodalGen3D is a generative framework that reconstructs complete, occlusion-free 3D objects from sparse and partially occluded views by integrating 2D amodal priors with multi-view stereo geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing 3D objects from sparse, unposed, and occluded views is challenging because many surfaces are never observed; traditional methods often produce incomplete or inconsistent results.

Method: AmodalGen3D uses a View-Wise Cross Attention mechanism for sparse-view feature fusion and a Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention module to infer unobserved structures, combining 2D amodal completion priors with multi-view stereo geometry conditioning.

Result: Experiments show AmodalGen3D achieves higher fidelity and completeness in occlusion-heavy, sparse-view scenarios on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: AmodalGen3D effectively addresses the challenge of amodal 3D reconstruction from limited observations, offering strong potential for applications in robotics, AR/VR, and embodied AI.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a few unposed and partially occluded views is a common yet challenging problem in real-world scenarios, where many object surfaces are never directly observed. Traditional multi-view or inpainting-based approaches struggle under such conditions, often yielding incomplete or geometrically inconsistent reconstructions. We introduce AmodalGen3D, a generative framework for amodal 3D object reconstruction that infers complete, occlusion-free geometry and appearance from arbitrary sparse inputs. The model integrates 2D amodal completion priors with multi-view stereo geometry conditioning, supported by a View-Wise Cross Attention mechanism for sparse-view feature fusion and a Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention module for unobserved structure inference. By jointly modeling visible and hidden regions, AmodalGen3D faithfully reconstructs 3D objects that are consistent with sparse-view constraints while plausibly hallucinating unseen parts. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that AmodalGen3D achieves superior fidelity and completeness under occlusion-heavy sparse-view settings, addressing a pressing need for object-level 3D scene reconstruction in robotics, AR/VR, and embodied AI applications.

### [6] [TAPVid-360: Tracking Any Point in 360 from Narrow Field of View Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21946)
*Finlay G. C. Hudson,James A. D. Gardner,William A. P. Smith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了TAPVid-360任务和TAPVid360-10k数据集，旨在实现对场景中任意点的全景方向追踪，即使这些点位于当前视野之外。通过利用360度视频作为监督信号，并将CoTracker v3适配为预测每点旋转以更新方向，该方法在新任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工视觉系统难以构建持久、全景式的场景理解，尤其在Track Any Point (TAP)任务中无法追踪视野外的2D点。人类则能构建包含物体恒存性和场景结构推断的全景心理模型。为弥合这一差距，作者提出新任务以促进系统学习以场景为中心（allocentric）的表示。

Method: 利用360度视频作为监督源，将其重采样为窄视场角的视角视频，并通过在全景上使用2D追踪管线计算出真实的方向信息。在此基础上构建了包含1万段带标注视频的新数据集TAPVid360-10k。基线模型基于CoTracker v3，通过预测每个点的旋转来更新其3D方向。

Result: 所提出的基线方法在TAPVid-360任务上优于现有的TAP和TAPVid 3D方法，验证了新任务和数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: TAPVid-360任务能够有效推动模型学习无需动态4D真值的以场景为中心的表示，为实现更接近人类的全景场景理解提供了新途径。

Abstract: Humans excel at constructing panoramic mental models of their surroundings, maintaining object permanence and inferring scene structure beyond visible regions. In contrast, current artificial vision systems struggle with persistent, panoramic understanding, often processing scenes egocentrically on a frame-by-frame basis. This limitation is pronounced in the Track Any Point (TAP) task, where existing methods fail to track 2D points outside the field of view. To address this, we introduce TAPVid-360, a novel task that requires predicting the 3D direction to queried scene points across a video sequence, even when far outside the narrow field of view of the observed video. This task fosters learning allocentric scene representations without needing dynamic 4D ground truth scene models for training. Instead, we exploit 360 videos as a source of supervision, resampling them into narrow field-of-view perspectives while computing ground truth directions by tracking points across the full panorama using a 2D pipeline. We introduce a new dataset and benchmark, TAPVid360-10k comprising 10k perspective videos with ground truth directional point tracking. Our baseline adapts CoTracker v3 to predict per-point rotations for direction updates, outperforming existing TAP and TAPVid 3D methods.

### [7] [WalkCLIP: Multimodal Learning for Urban Walkability Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21947)
*Shilong Xiang,JangHyeon Lee,Min Namgung,Yao-Yi Chiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WalkCLIP is a multimodal framework that combines satellite imagery, street view imagery, and population dynamics to better predict urban walkability by integrating complementary visual and behavioral signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional walkability assessments are costly and hard to scale; single-source approaches (e.g., satellite, street view, or population data) capture only partial aspects of the walking environment.

Method: WalkCLIP uses GPT-4o-generated image captions to learn walkability-aware vision-language representations, refines them with a spatial aggregation module for neighborhood context, and fuses them with features from a population dynamics foundation model.

Result: Evaluated at 4,660 locations in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms both unimodal and multimodal baselines in predictive accuracy and spatial alignment.

Conclusion: Integrating visual (satellite and street view) and behavioral (population dynamics) signals provides more reliable and comprehensive predictions of urban walkability.

Abstract: Urban walkability is a cornerstone of public health, sustainability, and quality of life. Traditional walkability assessments rely on surveys and field audits, which are costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies have used satellite imagery, street view imagery, or population indicators to estimate walkability, but these single-source approaches capture only one dimension of the walking environment. Satellite data describe the built environment from above, but overlook the pedestrian perspective. Street view imagery captures conditions at the ground level, but lacks broader spatial context. Population dynamics reveal patterns of human activity but not the visual form of the environment. We introduce WalkCLIP, a multimodal framework that integrates these complementary viewpoints to predict urban walkability. WalkCLIP learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, refines these representations with a spatial aggregation module that incorporates neighborhood context, and fuses the resulting features with representations from a population dynamics foundation model. Evaluated at 4,660 locations throughout Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment. These results show that the integration of visual and behavioral signals yields reliable predictions of the walking environment.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative model analysis on a novel gastrointestinal medical imaging dataset, comprised of 4,000 endoscopic images spanning four critical disease classes: Diverticulosis, Neoplasm, Peritonitis, and Ureters. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, the study confronts common endoscopic challenges such as variable lighting, fluctuating camera angles, and frequent imaging artifacts. The best performing models, VGG16 and MobileNetV2, each achieved a test accuracy of 96.5%, while Xception reached 94.24%, establishing robust benchmarks and baselines for automated disease classification. In addition to strong classification performance, the approach includes explainable AI via Grad-CAM visualization, enabling identification of image regions most influential to model predictions and enhancing clinical interpretability. Experimental results demonstrate the potential for robust, accurate, and interpretable medical image analysis even in complex real-world conditions. This work contributes original benchmarks, comparative insights, and visual explanations, advancing the landscape of gastrointestinal computer-aided diagnosis and underscoring the importance of diverse, clinically relevant datasets and model explainability in medical AI research.

TL;DR: PAT3D 是首个结合视觉语言模型与物理仿真的文本到3D场景生成框架，能生成物理合理、无交叠且可直接用于仿真的3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到3D生成方法缺乏物理合理性与仿真就绪能力，难以支持下游任务如机器人操作和场景编辑。

Method: PAT3D 利用文本提示生成3D物体并构建层次化场景树，将其转化为物理仿真的初始条件；通过可微刚体模拟器在重力作用下优化场景至静态平衡，并引入仿真循环优化以确保无穿透、物理稳定性和语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明 PAT3D 在物理合理性、语义一致性和视觉质量方面显著优于现有方法，并能生成可用于下游任务的仿真就绪场景。

Conclusion: PAT3D 成功将物理仿真融入文本到3D生成流程，不仅提升了生成质量，还为机器人操作等应用提供了实用的仿真就绪3D场景。

Abstract: We introduce PAT3D, the first physics-augmented text-to-3D scene generation framework that integrates vision-language models with physics-based simulation to produce physically plausible, simulation-ready, and intersection-free 3D scenes. Given a text prompt, PAT3D generates 3D objects, infers their spatial relations, and organizes them into a hierarchical scene tree, which is then converted into initial conditions for simulation. A differentiable rigid-body simulator ensures realistic object interactions under gravity, driving the scene toward static equilibrium without interpenetrations. To further enhance scene quality, we introduce a simulation-in-the-loop optimization procedure that guarantees physical stability and non-intersection, while improving semantic consistency with the input prompt. Experiments demonstrate that PAT3D substantially outperforms prior approaches in physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and visual quality. Beyond high-quality generation, PAT3D uniquely enables simulation-ready 3D scenes for downstream tasks such as scene editing and robotic manipulation. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

*Futian Wang,Chaoliu Weng,Xiao Wang,Zhen Chen,Zhicheng Zhao,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为RPM-10K的大规模指针式仪表读数数据集，并基于物理关系注入构建了一个新型视觉-语言模型MRLM，用于提升在复杂环境下（如反光、遮挡、视角变化等）的读数识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指针式仪表读数方法在面对反光、遮挡、动态视角以及指针与刻度线过于接近等挑战时表现脆弱，且缺乏大规模数据集支持鲁棒算法的发展。

Method: 提出RPM-10K数据集（含10730张图像），并在此基础上构建MRLM模型，该模型通过显式编码指针与刻度之间的几何与因果关系，结合交叉注意力融合与自适应专家选择机制，实现对表盘配置的理解与数值读取。

Result: 在新提出的RPM-10K数据集上进行了大量实验，验证了所提MRLM框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过引入物理关系建模和大规模真实场景数据集，显著提升了指针式仪表读数识别的鲁棒性和准确性，为智能电力系统中的自动化读表任务提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The precise reading recognition of pointer meters plays a key role in smart power systems, but existing approaches remain fragile due to challenges like reflections, occlusions, dynamic viewing angles, and overly between thin pointers and scale markings. Up to now, this area still lacks large-scale datasets to support the development of robust algorithms. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a new large-scale benchmark dataset for dial reading, termed RPM-10K, which contains 10730 meter images that fully reflect the aforementioned key challenges. Built upon the dataset, we propose a novel vision-language model for pointer meter reading recognition, termed MRLM, based on physical relation injection. Instead of exhaustively learning image-level correlations, MRLM explicitly encodes the geometric and causal relationships between the pointer and the scale, aligning perception with physical reasoning in the spirit of world-model perspectives. Through cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection, the model learns to interpret dial configurations and generate precise numeric readings. Extensive experiments fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework on the newly proposed benchmark dataset. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/DialBench

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Qualcomm Interactive Cooking数据集和基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在实时交互式指导任务中的表现，并引入了专为此设计的流式多模态模型LiveMamba。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型虽具备较强对话能力，但在提供实时、交互式的分步指导方面存在不足，尤其缺乏对用户操作执行情况的检测与错误提醒能力。为推动未来AI助手在此方向的发展，亟需支持异步响应视频流并能识别用户错误的新模型和评测基准。

Method: 作者基于CaptainCook4D构建了Qualcomm Interactive Cooking数据集，包含用户在任务执行中的错误及其修正，并提供密集标注、带时间戳的指令与反馈信息（包括精确到视频帧的错误提示）。同时提出LiveMamba模型，一种面向交互式教学指导的流式多模态大语言模型，并在该新基准上对现有SOTA模型进行评估。

Result: 实验表明现有主流多模态大语言模型在该实时交互指导任务中表现有限，而所提出的LiveMamba模型作为强基线，在该新基准上展现出更优性能。

Conclusion: 本研究首次提出了专门用于实时情境化指导任务的评测基准和数据集，并提供了有效的基线模型，为未来开发具备实时交互指导能力的AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLM) have advanced conversational abilities but struggle with providing live, interactive step-by-step guidance, a key capability for future AI assistants. Effective guidance requires not only delivering instructions but also detecting their successful execution, as well as identifying and alerting users to mistakes, all of which has to happen in real-time. This requires models that are not turn-based, but that can react asynchronously to a video stream, as well as video data showing users performing tasks including mistakes and their corrections. To this end, we introduce Qualcomm Interactive Cooking, a new benchmark and dataset built upon CaptainCook4D, which contains user mistakes during task execution. Our dataset and benchmark features densely annotated, timed instructions and feedback messages, specifically including mistake alerts precisely timestamped to their visual occurrence in the video. We evaluate state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs on the Qualcomm Interactive Cooking benchmark and introduce LiveMamba, a streaming multi-modal LLM designed for interactive instructional guidance. This work provides the first dedicated benchmark and a strong baseline for developing and evaluating on live, situated coaching.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一套针对Rectified Flow模型的综合加速方案，在理论、设计和推理策略方面进行优化，显著提升了基于流模型的图像生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Rectified Flow等新模型在理论上与现有扩散模型存在差异，传统加速方法无法直接适用，因此需要开发专门的加速策略。

Method: 提出包括新型速度场批处理、异构时间步批处理向量化以及动态TensorRT编译在内的整体加速流程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法可将512*512图像生成速度提升高达611%，远超现有公开方法（通常仅提升18%）。

Conclusion: 所提出的加速管道有效解决了Rectified Flow模型的效率瓶颈，为基于流的生成模型提供了高效推理的新路径。

Abstract: New technologies such as Rectified Flow and Flow Matching have significantly improved the performance of generative models in the past two years, especially in terms of control accuracy, generation quality, and generation efficiency. However, due to some differences in its theory, design, and existing diffusion models, the existing acceleration methods cannot be directly applied to the Rectified Flow model. In this article, we have comprehensively implemented an overall acceleration pipeline from the aspects of theory, design, and reasoning strategies. This pipeline uses new methods such as batch processing with a new velocity field, vectorization of heterogeneous time-step batch processing, and dynamic TensorRT compilation for the new methods to comprehensively accelerate related models based on flow models. Currently, the existing public methods usually achieve an acceleration of 18%, while experiments have proved that our new method can accelerate the 512*512 image generation speed to up to 611%, which is far beyond the current non-generalized acceleration methods.

### [13] [MedEyes: Learning Dynamic Visual Focus for Medical Progressive Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22018)
*Chunzheng Zhu,Yangfang Lin,Shen Chen,Yijun Wang,Jianxin Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出MedEyes，一种结合专家视觉轨迹引导与强化学习的新型医学视觉问答框架，通过模拟临床医生逐步聚焦与推理过程，在多个医学VQA基准上平均提升8.5%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于链式思维（CoT）的视觉语言模型在医学诊断中常因仅采用on-policy强化学习而生成表面连贯但临床不准确的推理路径，缺乏对临床真实视觉推理过程的建模。

Method: 提出MedEyes框架，引入Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator（GRN）模拟系统性扫描与细节钻取的双模式探索策略，并设计Confidence Value Sampler（CVS）平衡专家模仿与自主探索；同时采用双流GRPO优化机制解耦on-policy与off-policy学习信号。

Result: MedEyes在多个医学视觉问答（VQA）基准上平均性能提升8.5%，验证了其在构建可解释医学AI系统方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过融合专家视觉轨迹作为外部行为信号并改进强化学习机制，MedEyes能更真实地模拟临床诊断推理过程，显著提升医学视觉语言模型的准确性与可解释性。

Abstract: Accurate medical diagnosis often involves progressive visual focusing and iterative reasoning, characteristics commonly observed in clinical workflows. While recent vision-language models demonstrate promising chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), their purely on-policy learning paradigm tends to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths. We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的后处理不确定性估计方法，用于对比式视觉-语言模型（VLM），通过衡量类别内视觉特征的一致性来检测错误预测，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的错误检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型（如CLIP）在开放词汇分类任务中表现优异，但容易对错误分类给出高置信度，影响其在安全关键场景中的可靠性。

Method: 提出一种与具体VLM无关、无需微调的方法，利用特征投影结合多元高斯分布构建类别特定的概率嵌入，以衡量类内视觉特征一致性，从而估计预测不确定性。

Result: 在ImageNet、Flowers102、Food101、EuroSAT和DTD等多个数据集上，该方法在错误检测方面显著优于确定性和概率性VLM基线，且仅需每类10张训练图像即可有效工作，并对分布偏移具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提方法是一种高效、通用且无需训练的不确定性估计策略，能显著提升VLM在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have gained popularity for their strong open vocabulary classification performance, but they are prone to assigning high confidence scores to misclassifications, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. We introduce a training-free, post-hoc uncertainty estimation method for contrastive VLMs that can be used to detect erroneous predictions. The key to our approach is to measure visual feature consistency within a class, using feature projection combined with multivariate Gaussians to create class-specific probabilistic embeddings. Our method is VLM-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, demonstrates robustness to distribution shift, and works effectively with as few as 10 training images per class. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, Flowers102, Food101, EuroSAT and DTD show state-of-the-art error detection performance, significantly outperforming both deterministic and probabilistic VLM baselines.

Abstract: Understanding human instructions is essential for enabling smooth human-robot interaction. In this work, we focus on object grounding, i.e., localizing an object of interest in a visual scene (e.g., an image) based on verbal human instructions. Despite recent progress, a dominant research trend relies on using text as an intermediate representation. These approaches typically transcribe speech to text, extract relevant object keywords, and perform grounding using models pretrained on large text-vision datasets. However, we question both the efficiency and robustness of such transcription-based pipelines. Specifically, we ask: Can we achieve direct audio-visual alignment without relying on text? To explore this possibility, we simplify the task by focusing on grounding from single-word spoken instructions. We introduce a new audio-based grounding dataset that covers a wide variety of objects and diverse human accents. We then adapt and benchmark several models from the closely audio-visual field. Our results demonstrate that direct grounding from audio is not only feasible but, in some cases, even outperforms transcription-based methods, especially in terms of robustness to linguistic variability. Our findings encourage a renewed interest in direct audio grounding and pave the way for more robust and efficient multimodal understanding systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单有效的无监督域自适应方法，通过在频域中调整图像风格来减少源域和目标域之间的差异，在推理时无需额外计算开销，并在多个域自适应目标检测基准上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的无监督域自适应（UDA）方法通常过于复杂，依赖对抗训练或复杂的辅助模型结构，难以实际部署；因此需要一种更简洁高效的UDA方法。

Method: 在训练阶段引入一个轻量级的预处理模块，通过在频域中学习图像风格迁移以缩小源域与目标域之间的分布差异，推理时完全移除该模块，不增加计算负担。

Result: 在多个域自适应目标检测（DAOD）基准上进行了大量实验，结果表明该方法在正常天气/合成数据到恶劣天气/低光照场景的迁移中取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 所提方法简洁高效，在不增加推理开销的前提下显著提升了域自适应目标检测的性能，具有良好的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) greatly facilitates the deployment of neural networks across diverse environments. However, most state-of-the-art approaches are overly complex, relying on challenging adversarial training strategies, or on elaborate architectural designs with auxiliary models for feature distillation and pseudo-label generation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective UDA method that learns to adapt image styles in the frequency domain to reduce the discrepancy between source and target domains. The proposed approach introduces only a lightweight pre-processing module during training and entirely discards it at inference time, thus incurring no additional computational overhead. We validate our method on domain-adaptive object detection (DAOD) tasks, where ground-truth annotations are easily accessible in source domains (e.g., normal-weather or synthetic conditions) but challenging to obtain in target domains (e.g., adverse weather or low-light scenes). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance gains on multiple benchmarks, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖变分自编码器（VAE）生成离散占用标记或使用鸟瞰图（BEV）表示，分别受限于表示容量有限和几何先验的结构性约束，难以有效建模时空依赖关系。

Method: 提出一种端到端的Transformer架构，直接从原始图像特征预测多帧未来3D占用，采用稀疏占用表示，绕过BEV投影和离散标记化过程，并利用注意力机制捕捉时空依赖。

Result: 在nuScenes基准上，该方法在1-3秒的未来占用预测任务中显著优于现有方法，并在任意未来轨迹条件下展现出鲁棒的场景动态理解能力。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过避免离散标记化和BEV表示的局限性，有效提升了3D场景占用预测的准确性和泛化能力，为未来自动驾驶感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel architecture for trajectory-conditioned forecasting of future 3D scene occupancy. In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.

TL;DR: 本文提出图像条件流形正则化（ICM）方法，通过利用稀疏但关键的结构信息（如颜色图和Canny边缘）对超分辨率结果进行正则化，以解决现有基于文本条件扩散模型在真实图像超分辨率任务中概念错位与生成质量不佳的问题，从而提升感知质量和整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实世界图像超分辨率方法通常使用文本条件扩散模型的生成先验进行正则化，但该方式在概念上与任务目标不一致（应直接关联低质量与高质量图像），且实践中常导致颜色失真和边缘模糊，表明其生成先验不适合该任务。

Method: 提出图像条件流形正则化（ICM），将输出正则化到一个由稀疏结构信息（颜色图与Canny边缘）所条件化的流形上，避免直接使用高信息密度原始图像带来的数值不稳定性，同时保证任务对齐性与正则化稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法显著提升了真实图像超分辨率的性能，尤其在感知质量方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过引入与任务对齐且稳定的图像条件流形正则化，ICM有效克服了现有方法的局限性，在真实世界超分辨率任务中展现出优越性能，并将开源代码以促进可复现性。

Abstract: Real world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) often leverages the powerful generative priors of text-to-image diffusion models by regularizing the output to lie on their learned manifold. However, existing methods often overlook the importance of the regularizing manifold, typically defaulting to a text-conditioned manifold. This approach suffers from two key limitations. Conceptually, it is misaligned with the Real-ISR task, which is to generate high quality (HQ) images directly tied to the low quality (LQ) images. Practically, the teacher model often reconstructs images with color distortions and blurred edges, indicating a flawed generative prior for this task. To correct these flaws and ensure conceptual alignment, a more suitable manifold must incorporate information from the images. While the most straightforward approach is to condition directly on the raw input images, their high information densities make the regularization process numerically unstable. To resolve this, we propose image-conditioned manifold regularization (ICM), a method that regularizes the output towards a manifold conditioned on the sparse yet essential structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. ICM provides a task-aligned and stable regularization signal, thereby avoiding the instability of dense-conditioning and enhancing the final super-resolution quality. Our experiments confirm that the proposed regularization significantly enhances super-resolution performance, particularly in perceptual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world applications. We will release the source code of our work for reproducibility.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited immense potential across numerous medical specialties; yet, dentistry remains underexplored, in part due to limited domain-specific data, scarce dental expert annotations, insufficient modality-specific modeling, and challenges in reliability. In this paper, we present OralGPT-Omni, the first dental-specialized MLLM designed for comprehensive and trustworthy analysis across diverse dental imaging modalities and clinical tasks. To explicitly capture dentists' diagnostic reasoning, we construct TRACE-CoT, a clinically grounded chain-of-thought dataset that mirrors dental radiologists' decision-making processes. This reasoning supervision, combined with our proposed four-stage training paradigm, substantially strengthens the model's capacity for dental image understanding and analysis. In parallel, we introduce MMOral-Uni, the first unified multimodal benchmark for dental image analysis. It comprises 2,809 open-ended question-answer pairs spanning five modalities and five tasks, offering a comprehensive evaluation suite to date for MLLMs in digital dentistry. OralGPT-Omni achieves an overall score of 51.84 on the MMOral-Uni benchmark and 45.31 on the MMOral-OPG benchmark, dramatically outperforming the scores of GPT-5. Our work promotes intelligent dentistry and paves the way for future advances in dental image analysis. All code, benchmark, and models will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: WorldWander effectively bridges egocentric and exocentric video perspectives through innovative alignment mechanisms and a large-scale dataset, advancing the state of the art in controllable video generation.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable progress in realism and controllability. However, achieving seamless video translation across different perspectives, such as first-person (egocentric) and third-person (exocentric), remains underexplored. Bridging these perspectives is crucial for filmmaking, embodied AI, and world models. Motivated by this, we present WorldWander, an in-context learning framework tailored for translating between egocentric and exocentric worlds in video generation. Building upon advanced video diffusion transformers, WorldWander integrates (i) In-Context Perspective Alignment and (ii) Collaborative Position Encoding to efficiently model cross-view synchronization. To further support our task, we curate EgoExo-8K, a large-scale dataset containing synchronized egocentric-exocentric triplets from both synthetic and real-world scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that WorldWander achieves superior perspective synchronization, character consistency, and generalization, setting a new benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注点位级别的图像-基因匹配，未能充分利用空间转录组数据（尤其是基因表达侧）的层次结构，且图像与基因表达之间存在信息不对称问题，缺乏有效的跨模态表示学习策略。

Method: HyperST包含两个核心模块：1）多级表征提取器，分别从图像和基因表达中提取点位级和微环境级表征；2）层次化双曲对齐模块，在双曲空间中统一并层次化地对齐两种模态的嵌入，增强图像表征的分子语义。

Result: HyperST在四个不同组织的公开数据集上达到当前最优性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过在双曲空间中建模空间转录组数据的固有层次结构，HyperST有效弥合了组织图像与基因表达之间的模态鸿沟，为更高效、准确的空间转录组预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) merges the benefits of pathology images and gene expression, linking molecular profiles with tissue structure to analyze spot-level function comprehensively. Predicting gene expression from histology images is a cost-effective alternative to expensive ST technologies. However, existing methods mainly focus on spot-level image-to-gene matching but fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure of ST data, especially on the gene expression side, leading to incomplete image-gene alignment. Moreover, a challenge arises from the inherent information asymmetry: gene expression profiles contain more molecular details that may lack salient visual correlates in histological images, demanding a sophisticated representation learning approach to bridge this modality gap. We propose HyperST, a framework for ST prediction that learns multi-level image-gene representations by modeling the data's inherent hierarchy within hyperbolic space, a natural geometric setting for such structures. First, we design a Multi-Level Representation Extractors to capture both spot-level and niche-level representations from each modality, providing context-aware information beyond individual spot-level image-gene pairs. Second, a Hierarchical Hyperbolic Alignment module is introduced to unify these representations, performing spatial alignment while hierarchically structuring image and gene embeddings. This alignment strategy enriches the image representations with molecular semantics, significantly improving cross-modal prediction. HyperST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets from different tissues, paving the way for more scalable and accurate spatial transcriptomics prediction.

Motivation: 高质量文本提示作为数字资产价值日益提升，但面临被窃取的风险；现有提示窃取方法依赖白盒访问、大规模标注数据或仅使用图像描述，实用性受限。

Method: PROMPTMINER将提示窃取任务分为两个阶段：（1）基于强化学习优化重建图像主体；（2）通过模糊搜索恢复风格修饰词，整个过程无需模型梯度或训练数据。

Result: 在多个数据集和扩散模型上，PROMPTMINER的CLIP相似度最高达0.958，SBERT文本对齐达0.751；对未知生成器的野外图像，CLIP相似度比最强基线高7.5%，且在防御扰动下仍表现稳健。

Conclusion: PROMPTMINER是一种高效、通用且鲁棒的黑盒提示窃取方法，既揭示了提示安全风险，也为数据溯源等有益应用提供支持。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX can synthesize realistic, high-quality images directly from textual prompts. The resulting image quality depends critically on well-crafted prompts that specify both subjects and stylistic modifiers, which have become valuable digital assets. However, the rising value and ubiquity of high-quality prompts expose them to security and intellectual-property risks. One key threat is the prompt stealing attack, i.e., the task of recovering the textual prompt that generated a given image. Prompt stealing enables unauthorized extraction and reuse of carefully engineered prompts, yet it can also support beneficial applications such as data attribution, model provenance analysis, and watermarking validation. Existing approaches often assume white-box gradient access, require large-scale labeled datasets for supervised training, or rely solely on captioning without explicit optimization, limiting their practicality and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose PROMPTMINER, a black-box prompt stealing framework that decouples the task into two phases: (1) a reinforcement learning-based optimization phase to reconstruct the primary subject, and (2) a fuzzing-driven search phase to recover stylistic modifiers. Experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion backbones demonstrate that PROMPTMINER achieves superior results, with CLIP similarity up to 0.958 and textual alignment with SBERT up to 0.751, surpassing all baselines. Even when applied to in-the-wild images with unknown generators, it outperforms the strongest baseline by 7.5 percent in CLIP similarity, demonstrating better generalization. Finally, PROMPTMINER maintains strong performance under defensive perturbations, highlighting remarkable robustness. Code: https://github.com/aaFrostnova/PromptMiner

Motivation: 在视频任务中对视觉-语言模型进行软提示微调会损害其对未见类别的泛化能力。现有方法通过正则化手工提示与软提示之间的差距来缓解遗忘效应，但这又削弱了软提示的学习能力。因此，作者旨在通过引入外部监督提示来缓解微调过程中语义空间的收窄，以保持模型的泛化性能。

Method: 该方法包含两个核心部分：1）对于文本提示，引入来自其他数据集的预训练提示作为硬提示标记，将其与软提示标记拼接，并通过一个可学习的映射层进行耦合，形成一种竞争性提示机制；2）引入精心设计的无关视频集和负提示作为通用属性锚点，以维持预训练语义空间中属性的通用相关性。

Result: 在视频任务上的实验表明，该方法在泛化基准测试中显著优于当前最先进的提示微调方法，尤其是在基类到新类的预测任务上表现突出。

Conclusion: 所提出的耦合提示学习框架能有效解决视频任务中VLM微调导致的泛化能力下降问题，通过外部监督和通用属性锚点成功维持了模型对未见类别的识别能力。

Abstract: Visual and textual soft prompt tuning can effectively improve the adaptability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning on video tasks impairs the model's generalization ability to unseen classes. Existing methods attempt to mitigate this forgetting effect by regularizing the gap between hand-crafted prompts and soft prompts, but this also weakens the learning ability of soft prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework to optimize the generalization performance of V-L models in video tasks, with the core motivation of mitigating semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning by introducing an externally supervised prompt. Specifically, for textual prompts, we introduce pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard prompt tokens. These are concatenated with soft prompt tokens and coupled via a learnable mapping layer. This competitive prompting approach prevents the semantic space from overfitting to supervised categories. In addition, we introduce a set of well-designed irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors to maintain the generic relevance of the attributes in the pre-trained semantic space, thus preserving the generalization ability. Experiments on video tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning approaches across generalization benchmarks, particularly on base-to-new class prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用VLA模型在引入多模态数据增强推理能力后，常出现动作性能下降的问题（称为“动作退化”），亟需一种兼顾动作执行与推理能力的训练与优化策略。

Method: 提出DualVLA框架：1）采用双层数据剪枝方法去除冗余的具身推理数据，避免干扰动作学习；2）设计双教师自适应蒸馏策略，针对不同数据域提供差异化监督信号，同时维持推理能力；3）构建VLA Score评估体系，从推理、意图、动作和对齐四个维度解耦评估模型能力。

Result: DualVLA在SimplerEnv中达到61.0的平均成功率，在八个主流多模态基准上取得65.4的平均分，优于现有方法，在动作精度与多模态理解之间实现更好平衡。

Conclusion: DualVLA有效缓解了通用VLA模型中的动作退化问题，在保持强大推理能力的同时显著提升动作执行性能，所提出的评估指标VLA Score也为未来研究提供了更细粒度的评测标准。

Abstract: To build a generalizable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with strong reasoning ability, a common strategy is to first train a specialist VLA on robot demonstrations to acquire reliable manipulation skills, and then incorporate mixed annotated robot data together with multimodal data to restore broader reasoning capabilities. However, we observe that the resulting reasoning VLA often suffers from degraded action performance compared to the specialist model before fine-tuning, a phenomenon we refer to as action degeneration. To address this issue, we propose DualVLA, which enhances action performance through carefully designed post-training while still preserving reasoning capability. We first introduce a dual-layer data pruning method that removes redundant embodied reasoning, preventing it from adversely influencing action learning. To further strengthen action generation, we design a dual-teacher adaptive distillation strategy that assigns different supervision signals to different data domains while maintaining reasoning ability. To fill the evaluation gap for generalist VLAs, we also propose VLA Score, which decouples VLA capability into reasoning, intention, action, and alignment dimensions for a more fine-grained assessment. Experiments show that DualVLA achieves an average success rate of 61.0 in SimplerEnv and an average score of 65.4 across eight competitive multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating a stronger balance between precise action execution and multimodal understanding.

*Yanchao Zhao,Jihao Zhu,Yu Liu,Weizhuo Chen,Yuling Yang,Kun Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EASL is an emotion-aware sign language generation model that integrates multi-emotion guidance into pose generation, improving both expressiveness and semantic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language model (LLM)-based sign language generation methods focus on semantic correctness but neglect emotional expression, leading to unnatural and unexpressive outputs.

Method: EASL employs emotion-semantic disentanglement modules with progressive training to separately extract semantic and emotional features; during pose decoding, emotional representations modulate semantic interaction to produce poses annotated with 7-class emotion confidence scores.

Result: EASL outperforms all baselines in pose accuracy and successfully extends to diffusion models for generating expressive sign language videos.

Conclusion: Incorporating fine-grained emotional information significantly enhances the naturalness and expressiveness of generated sign language while maintaining or improving semantic fidelity.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized sign language generation by automatically transforming text into high-quality sign language videos, providing accessible communication for the Deaf community. However, existing LLM-based approaches prioritize semantic accuracy while overlooking emotional expressions, resulting in outputs that lack naturalness and expressiveness. We propose EASL (Emotion-Aware Sign Language), a multi-emotion-guided generation architecture for fine-grained emotional integration. We introduce emotion-semantic disentanglement modules with progressive training to separately extract semantic and affective features. During pose decoding, the emotional representations guide semantic interaction to generate sign poses with 7-class emotion confidence scores, enabling emotional expression recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that EASL achieves pose accuracy superior to all compared baselines by integrating multi-emotion information and effectively adapts to diffusion models to generate expressive sign language videos.

Abstract: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a musculoskeletal condition that can cause significant limitations and impairments in daily activities, especially among older individuals. To evaluate the severity of KOA, typically, X-ray images of the affected knee are analyzed, and a grade is assigned based on the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which classifies KOA severity into five levels, ranging from 0 to 4. This approach requires a high level of expertise and time and is susceptible to subjective interpretation, thereby introducing potential diagnostic inaccuracies. To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum. The proposed stacked ensemble model consists of a diverse set of pre-trained architectures, including MobileNetV2, You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), and DenseNet201 as base learners and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner. This proposed model had a balanced test accuracy of 73% in multiclass classification and 87.5% in binary classification, which is higher than previous works in extant literature.

Abstract: As a mainstream technique for 3D reconstruction, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has been applied in a wide range of applications and services. Recent studies have revealed critical vulnerabilities in this pipeline and introduced computation cost attacks that lead to malicious resource occupancies and even denial-of-service (DoS) conditions, thereby hindering the reliable deployment of 3DGS. In this paper, we propose the first effective and comprehensive black-box defense framework, named RemedyGS, against such computation cost attacks, safeguarding 3DGS reconstruction systems and services. Our pipeline comprises two key components: a detector to identify the attacked input images with poisoned textures and a purifier to recover the benign images from their attacked counterparts, mitigating the adverse effects of these attacks. Moreover, we incorporate adversarial training into the purifier to enforce distributional alignment between the recovered and original natural images, thereby enhancing the defense efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively defends against white-box, black-box, and adaptive attacks in 3DGS systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both safety and utility.

Abstract: Talking face generation aims to synthesize realistic speaking portraits from a single image, yet existing methods often rely on explicit optical flow and local warping, which fail to model complex global motions and cause identity drift. We present IMTalker, a novel framework that achieves efficient and high-fidelity talking face generation through implicit motion transfer. The core idea is to replace traditional flow-based warping with a cross-attention mechanism that implicitly models motion discrepancy and identity alignment within a unified latent space, enabling robust global motion rendering. To further preserve speaker identity during cross-identity reenactment, we introduce an identity-adaptive module that projects motion latents into personalized spaces, ensuring clear disentanglement between motion and identity. In addition, a lightweight flow-matching motion generator produces vivid and controllable implicit motion vectors from audio, pose, and gaze cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMTalker surpasses prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization, achieving state-of-the-art quality with superior efficiency, operating at 40 FPS for video-driven and 42 FPS for audio-driven generation on an RTX 4090 GPU. We will release our code and pre-trained models to facilitate applications and future research.

TL;DR: 本文针对东亚复杂地形下颗粒物（PM）浓度长期预报的挑战，构建并发布了高分辨率CMAQ-OBS数据集，并提出Group-Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）方法，通过类别奖励和课程回滚机制优化预测结果，显著降低误报率47.3%，同时保持有竞争力的F1分数，提升长期空气质量预报在公共健康预警中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型（如Aurora）虽具全球通用性，但难以捕捉区域特异性动态，且依赖非实时输入，限制了其在局部预警系统中的应用；此外，标准逐点损失函数无法反映实际业务中不对称的成本（误报损害公信力，漏报危及生命），导致监督微调（SFT）模型误报率高。

Method: 构建并发布东亚高分辨率CMAQ-OBS真实观测数据集；提出Group-Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）算法，结合类别级奖励和课程回滚策略，对预测进行强化学习优化，以匹配实际操作优先级。

Result: 所提方法在48–120小时长期预报中将区域误差降低59.5%，相比SFT基线模型，误报率降低47.3%，同时保持有竞争力的F1分数。

Conclusion: 本文提出的GRPO框架有效提升了长期空气质量预报的可靠性与实用性，特别适用于需要低误报率的公共健康预警场景。

Abstract: Accurate long horizon forecasting of particulate matter (PM) concentration fields is essential for operational public health decisions. However, achieving reliable forecasts remains challenging in regions with complex terrain and strong atmospheric dynamics such as East Asia. While foundation models such as Aurora offer global generality, they often miss region-specific dynamics and rely on non-real-time inputs, limiting their practical utility for localized warning systems. To address this gap, we construct and release the real-world observations and high-resolution CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia, reducing regional error by 59.5% and enabling real-time 48-120 hour forecasts critical for public health alerts. However, standard point-wise objectives cannot reflect asymmetric operational costs, where false alarms deteriorate public trust while missed severe events endanger populations. This cost mismatch causes SFT models to over-predict and yield high False Alarm Rates. We introduce Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the reliability of the forecast. Compared to the SFT-only baseline, our model reduces the False Alarm Rate by 47.3% while achieving a competitive F1-score, proving its effectiveness for practical, real-world air quality forecasting systems on long lead time scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM和VLM的Concept Bottleneck Models存在视觉接地差、概念冗余及缺乏兼顾准确率与概念紧凑性的评估指标三大问题。

Method: 提出PS-CBM框架，包含：(1)融合LLM语义与视觉示例的多模态概念生成器；(2)基于激活模式合并概念的部分共享策略；(3)联合衡量准确率与概念紧凑性的后验指标CEA。

Result: 在11个数据集上，PS-CBM相比SOTA方法提升分类准确率1.0%-7.4%，CEA提升2.0%-9.5%，且使用更少概念。

Conclusion: PS-CBM有效平衡了高预测准确率与强可解释性，显著优于现有CBM方法。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by introducing a layer of human-understandable concepts between inputs and predictions. While recent methods automate concept generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they still face three fundamental challenges: poor visual grounding, concept redundancy, and the absence of principled metrics to balance predictive accuracy and concept compactness. We introduce PS-CBM, a Partially Shared CBM framework that addresses these limitations through three core components: (1) a multimodal concept generator that integrates LLM-derived semantics with exemplar-based visual cues; (2) a Partially Shared Concept Strategy that merges concepts based on activation patterns to balance specificity and compactness; and (3) Concept-Efficient Accuracy (CEA), a post-hoc metric that jointly captures both predictive accuracy and concept compactness. Extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets show that PS-CBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CBMs, improving classification accuracy by 1.0%-7.4% and CEA by 2.0%-9.5%, while requiring significantly fewer concepts. These results underscore PS-CBM's effectiveness in achieving both high accuracy and strong interpretability.

Motivation: 现有方法在端到端强化学习的不稳定性与监督微调的僵化性之间难以平衡，导致模型要么难以学习，要么缺乏处理复杂现实场景所需的认知灵活性。

Method: GRiP框架包含一个认知增强的强化学习阶段，其核心创新包括：(1) 显著性加权IoU奖励，激励模型优先定位任务关键物体；(2) 多启发式奖励，鼓励模型采用多样但逻辑有效的推理路径。该模型以Qwen2.5-VL-7B为初始模型进行训练。

Result: GRiP在TreeBench和V* Bench等多个具有挑战性的基准测试中取得了开源模型中最先进的结果，显著提升了复杂视觉推理任务的性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入认知启发的信号来指导模型“看什么”和“如何思考”，而非使用简单的奖励机制，对于实现更高层次的多模态智能至关重要。

Abstract: Models capable of "thinking with images" by dynamically grounding their reasoning in visual evidence represent a major leap in multimodal AI. However, replicating and advancing this ability is non-trivial, with current methods often trapped between the instability of end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) and the rigidity of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This leads to models that either struggle to learn or lack the cognitive flexibility required for complex, real-world scenes. To navigate this dilemma, we introduce GRiP (Guided Reasoning and Perception), a novel two-stage training framework that cultivates robust and flexible visual grounded reasoning by explicitly guiding the model's perceptual focus and logical pathways. GRiP's core lies in its cognitive-enhanced RL stage, which features two key innovations: (1) a Salience-Weighted IoU Reward that incentivizes the model to prioritize the localization of mission-critical objects over trivial distractors, and (2) a Multi-Heuristic Reward that encourages cognitive flexibility by rewarding diverse yet logically valid reasoning pathways. Initialized from the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, GRiP demonstrates significant performance gains across multiple challenging benchmarks. It achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models on the highly challenging TreeBench and V* Bench, proving its effectiveness in complex visual reasoning. Our work demonstrates that moving beyond simplistic rewards and instead guiding models with cognitively-inspired signals for what to see and how to think is crucial for unlocking the next level of multimodal intelligence. The code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出MTR-VP方法，利用ViT编码器从图像和历史运动状态中学习上下文嵌入，替代传统基于地图的特征，并在Waymo端到端驾驶数据集上验证其性能；研究发现多轨迹预测优于单轨迹预测，但融合视觉与运动特征的Transformer方法在生成有效场景上下文嵌入方面效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶轨迹规划方法多依赖高精地图，而本文旨在探索仅使用图像输入进行端到端规划的可能性，通过学习视觉上下文嵌入来替代地图特征，并与运动预测框架对齐。

Method: 提出MTR-VP方法：采用ViT编码器处理原始图像和历史运动状态，生成上下文嵌入；借鉴MTR（Motion Transformer）结构，但将MTR解码器中的可学习意图查询替换为对意图嵌入与上下文嵌入的交叉注意力机制；在训练中结合路由目标、历史位姿和相机图像，在鸟瞰图坐标下预测未来5秒轨迹。

Result: 在Waymo端到端驾驶数据集上的实验表明，预测多个未来轨迹的分布比单一轨迹更有效；然而，即使引入CLIP和DINOv2等基础模型增强场景上下文表示，基于Transformer融合视觉与运动特征的方法仍难以有效生成有用的上下文嵌入。

Conclusion: MTR-VP展示了纯视觉端到端轨迹规划的潜力，尤其在多模态输出方面有优势，但当前的Transformer架构在有效融合视觉与运动信息方面仍存在挑战。

Abstract: We present a method for trajectory planning for autonomous driving, learning image-based context embeddings that align with motion prediction frameworks and planning-based intention input. Within our method, a ViT encoder takes raw images and past kinematic state as input and is trained to produce context embeddings, drawing inspiration from those generated by the recent MTR (Motion Transformer) encoder, effectively substituting map-based features with learned visual representations. MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states. We evaluate our methods on the Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset, which requires predicting the agent's future 5-second trajectory in bird's-eye-view coordinates using prior camera images, agent pose history, and routing goals. We analyze our architecture using ablation studies, removing input images and multiple trajectory output. Our results suggest that transformer-based methods that are used to combine the visual features along with the kinetic features such as the past trajectory features are not effective at combining both modes to produce useful scene context embeddings, even when intention embeddings are augmented with foundation-model representations of scene context from CLIP and DINOv2, but that predicting a distribution over multiple futures instead of a single future trajectory boosts planning performance.

Motivation: 足部接触在人类与环境的交互中至关重要，但现有方法通常使用零速度约束近似，并仅关注关节级接触，难以捕捉足部与地面之间细致的交互；同时，从单张RGB图像预测密集足部接触仍缺乏有效方法。

Method: 提出FECO框架，包含两个关键组件：1）鞋型对抗训练，以学习对不同鞋型具有不变性的接触特征；2）地面特征提取器，利用空间上下文捕获地面属性，从而提升接触估计的准确性。

Result: 所提方法在不同鞋型下均能实现鲁棒的密集足部接触估计，并有效利用地面信息，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入鞋型不变性和地面感知机制，FECO显著提升了从单张RGB图像中估计密集足部接触的准确性和泛化能力，为人体运动和物理交互建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foot contact plays a critical role in human interaction with the world, and thus exploring foot contact can advance our understanding of human movement and physical interaction. Despite its importance, existing methods often approximate foot contact using a zero-velocity constraint and focus on joint-level contact, failing to capture the detailed interaction between the foot and the world. Dense estimation of foot contact is crucial for accurately modeling this interaction, yet predicting dense foot contact from a single RGB image remains largely underexplored. There are two main challenges for learning dense foot contact estimation. First, shoes exhibit highly diverse appearances, making it difficult for models to generalize across different styles. Second, ground often has a monotonous appearance, making it difficult to extract informative features. To tackle these issues, we present a FEet COntact estimation (FECO) framework that learns dense foot contact with shoe style-invariant and ground-aware learning. To overcome the challenge of shoe appearance diversity, our approach incorporates shoe style adversarial training that enforces shoe style-invariant features for contact estimation. To effectively utilize ground information, we introduce a ground feature extractor that captures ground properties based on spatial context. As a result, our proposed method achieves robust foot contact estimation regardless of shoe appearance and effectively leverages ground information. Code will be released.

Abstract: Recently, the impressive generative capabilities of diffusion models have been demonstrated, producing images with remarkable fidelity. Particularly, existing methods for the 3D object generation tasks, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in computer vision, pre-dominantly use text-to-image diffusion models with textual inversion which train a pseudo text prompt to describe the given image. In practice, various text-to-image generative models employ textual inversion to learn concepts or styles of target object in the pseudo text prompt embedding space, thereby generating sophisticated outputs. However, textual inversion requires additional training time and lacks control ability. To tackle this issues, we propose two innovative methods: (1) using an off-the-shelf image adapter that generates 3D objects without textual inversion, offering enhanced control over conditions such as depth, pose, and text. (2) a depth conditioned warmup strategy to enhance 3D consistency. In experimental results, ours show qualitatively and quantitatively comparable performance and improved 3D consistency to the existing text-inversion-based alternatives. Furthermore, we conduct a user study to assess (i) how well results match the input image and (ii) whether 3D consistency is maintained. User study results show that our model outperforms the alternatives, validating the effectiveness of our approaches.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了多视角图像编辑中的一致性问题，为高质量3D内容编辑提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have greatly improved text-based image editing, yet methods that edit images independently often produce geometrically and photometrically inconsistent results across different views of the same scene. Such inconsistencies are particularly problematic for editing of 3D representations such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models. We propose a training-free diffusion framework that enforces multi-view consistency during the image editing process. The key assumption is that corresponding points in the unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing. To achieve this, we introduce a consistency loss that guides the diffusion sampling toward coherent edits. The framework is flexible and can be combined with widely varying image editing methods, supporting both dense and sparse multi-view editing setups. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency compared to existing multi-view editing methods. We also show that this increased consistency enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and strong fidelity to user-specified text prompts.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in advancing healthcare. However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios. Notably, M3LLM exhibits strong generalization to longitudinal chest X-ray analysis using the MIMIC dataset. This work establishes a scalable and efficient paradigm for developing medical MLLMs capable of composite reasoning, bridging the gap between biomedical literature and real-world clinical applications.

Conclusion: IE-SRGS有效解决了3D高斯泼溅超分中的跨视角不一致与域偏移问题，显著提升了重建保真度。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution (HR) 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models from low-resolution (LR) inputs remains challenging due to the lack of fine-grained textures and geometry. Existing methods typically rely on pre-trained 2D super-resolution (2DSR) models to enhance textures, but suffer from 3D Gaussian ambiguity arising from cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps inherent in 2DSR models. We propose IE-SRGS, a novel 3DGS SR paradigm that addresses this issue by jointly leveraging the complementary strengths of external 2DSR priors and internal 3DGS features. Specifically, we use 2DSR and depth estimation models to generate HR images and depth maps as external knowledge, and employ multi-scale 3DGS models to produce cross-view consistent, domain-adaptive counterparts as internal knowledge. A mask-guided fusion strategy is introduced to integrate these two sources and synergistically exploit their complementary strengths, effectively guiding the 3D Gaussian optimization toward high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that IE-SRGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative accuracy and visual fidelity.

TL;DR: VessQC 是一个开源工具，利用不确定性引导用户高效校正3D显微图像分割中的关键错误，显著提升错误检出率而不增加总校正时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的基础模型在3D显微图像分割中仍会产生错误，因此依赖人工校正来准备高质量训练数据或修正分析前的错误。

Method: VessQC 结合不确定性图，将用户注意力引导至最可能存在生物学意义错误的区域，实现不确定性引导的3D分割结果人工校正。

Result: 初步用户研究表明，与传统方法相比，不确定性引导校正将错误检测召回率从67%显著提升至94.0%（p=0.007），且未显著增加总校正时间。

Conclusion: VessQC 有效实现了人在回路的体数据分割优化，在不确定性估计与实际人机交互之间架起了关键桥梁，适用于真实场景中的生物图像分析。

Abstract: Accurate 3D microscopy image segmentation is critical for quantitative bioimage analysis but even state-of-the-art foundation models yield error-prone results. Therefore, manual curation is still widely used for either preparing high-quality training data or fixing errors before analysis. We present VessQC, an open-source tool for uncertainty-guided curation of large 3D microscopy segmentations. By integrating uncertainty maps, VessQC directs user attention to regions most likely containing biologically meaningful errors. In a preliminary user study uncertainty-guided correction significantly improved error detection recall from 67% to 94.0% (p=0.007) without a significant increase in total curation time. VessQC thus enables efficient, human-in-the-loop refinement of volumetric segmentations and bridges a key gap in real-world applications between uncertainty estimation and practical human-computer interaction.

### [40] [Creating Blank Canvas Against AI-enabled Image Forgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22237)
*Qi Song,Ziyuan Luo,Renjie Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于SAM模型的新型图像篡改检测方法，通过引入对抗扰动和频域感知优化策略，使SAM“看不见”原始图像内容，从而在图像被篡改时有效定位伪造区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGC技术使图像编辑变得极为逼真且易于操作，带来严重的图像伪造风险，亟需有效的篡改检测手段。

Method: 将整幅图像通过对抗扰动转化为神经模型视角下的“空白画布”，并结合频域感知优化策略，使SAM模型对原始内容“失明”，从而在图像被篡改时识别出异常区域。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提方法在图像篡改定位任务中具有良好的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法利用SAM强大的感知能力，结合对抗扰动与频域优化，为AIGC时代下的图像真实性验证提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: AIGC-based image editing technology has greatly simplified the realistic-level image modification, causing serious potential risks of image forgery. This paper introduces a new approach to tampering detection using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Instead of training SAM to identify tampered areas, we propose a novel strategy. The entire image is transformed into a blank canvas from the perspective of neural models. Any modifications to this blank canvas would be noticeable to the models. To achieve this idea, we introduce adversarial perturbations to prevent SAM from ``seeing anything'', allowing it to identify forged regions when the image is tampered with. Due to SAM's powerful perceiving capabilities, naive adversarial attacks cannot completely tame SAM. To thoroughly deceive SAM and make it blind to the image, we introduce a frequency-aware optimization strategy, which further enhances the capability of tamper localization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

*Qingtao Yu,Changlin Song,Minghao Sun,Zhengyang Yu,Vinay Kumar Verma,Soumya Roy,Sumit Negi,Hongdong Li,Dylan Campbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出TTSnap，一种用于文本到图像扩散模型的测试时缩放框架，通过在去噪过程中引入噪声感知剪枝机制，在不完全生成图像的情况下提前剔除低质量候选样本，从而显著提升计算效率与生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法依赖于对多个噪声种子完全去噪后评估奖励函数，计算开销大，限制了可探索样本数量；且中间去噪阶段的奖励预测与最终图像奖励不一致，难以有效剪枝。

Method: 提出噪声感知奖励模型，通过自蒸馏训练使其能对中间去噪结果给出与最终图像一致的奖励预测，并结合课程学习策略从干净图像逐步过渡到噪声图像进行训练；同时设计新指标衡量奖励一致性与计算资源利用效率。

Result: 实验表明TTSnap相比现有方法性能提升超过16%，并能与后训练技术和局部测试时优化方法正交结合，进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: TTSnap有效解决了测试时缩放中计算成本高和奖励不一致的问题，实现了更高效、更有效的图像生成优化。

Abstract: A prominent approach to test-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models formulates the problem as a search over multiple noise seeds, selecting the one that maximizes a certain image-reward function. The effectiveness of this strategy heavily depends on the number and diversity of noise seeds explored. However, verifying each candidate is computationally expensive, because each must be fully denoised before a reward can be computed. This severely limits the number of samples that can be explored under a fixed budget. We propose test-time scaling with noise-aware pruning (TTSnap), a framework that prunes low-quality candidates without fully denoising them. The key challenge is that reward models are learned in the clean image domain, and the ranking of rewards predicted for intermediate estimates are often inconsistent with those predicted for clean images. To overcome this, we train noise-aware reward models via self-distillation to align the reward for intermediate estimates with that of the final clean images. To stabilize learning across different noise levels, we adopt a curriculum training strategy that progressively shifts the data domain from clean images to noise images. In addition, we introduce a new metric that measures reward alignment and computational budget utilization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves performance by over 16\% compared with existing methods, enabling more efficient and effective test-time scaling. It also provides orthogonal gains when combined with post-training techniques and local test-time optimization. Code: https://github.com/TerrysLearning/TTSnap/.

### [42] [Semantic Anchoring for Robust Personalization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22245)
*Seoyun Yang,Gihoon Kim,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于语义锚定的个性化方法，通过将新概念与其常见对应物关联，在保持预训练模型语义结构的同时，实现对用户特定主体的稳定、可控适应，从而在主体保真度和文本-图像对齐方面均优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在个性化任务中面临两难：仅用少量参考图学习新视觉概念时，若强调主体保真易过拟合，若强调保留预训练语义先验则难以学习新属性。

Method: 提出语义锚定策略，将个性化过程重构为在常见概念引导下学习稀有概念，使模型在扩展预训练分布至个性化区域的同时，保持其语义结构。

Result: 所提方法在主体保真度和文本-图像对齐方面均取得稳定提升，大量实验和消融研究验证了该锚定策略的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 通过语义锚定引导个性化适应，可在不破坏预训练语义先验的前提下有效学习用户特定概念，实现更优的生成效果。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating diverse and realistic images from textual descriptions. However, they still struggle with personalization, which requires adapting a pretrained model to depict user-specific subjects from only a few reference images. The key challenge lies in learning a new visual concept from a limited number of reference images while preserving the pretrained semantic prior that maintains text-image alignment. When the model focuses on subject fidelity, it tends to overfit the limited reference images and fails to leverage the pretrained distribution. Conversely, emphasizing prior preservation maintains semantic consistency but prevents the model from learning new personalized attributes. Building on these observations, we propose the personalization process through a semantic anchoring that guides adaptation by grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions. We therefore reformulate personalization as the process of learning a rare concept guided by its frequent counterpart through semantic anchoring. This anchoring encourages the model to adapt new concepts in a stable and controlled manner, expanding the pretrained distribution toward personalized regions while preserving its semantic structure. As a result, the proposed method achieves stable adaptation and consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed anchoring strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了UMind-VL，一种统一的超声基础模型，通过结合像素级结构理解与临床推理，同时支持分割、检测、测量和诊断任务，并在多个基准上达到或超越现有先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学基础模型在超声领域缺乏能同时处理低层级感知（如分割、定位）和高层级综合解读（如诊断、推理）的统一解决方案。

Method: 构建包含120万对图像-文本的多模态数据集UMind-DS，并设计轻量级动态卷积掩码解码器，结合大语言模型输出与任务特定token，在单一框架中统一多种超声任务。

Result: UMind-VL在分割、检测、关键点定位和诊断推理等多个任务上显著优于通用多模态模型，性能媲美或超越专用SOTA模型，且具备良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: UMind-VL成功弥合了超声低层感知与高层解读之间的鸿沟，为超声智能分析提供了一个统一、高效且通用的基础模型框架。

Abstract: Despite significant strides in medical foundation models, the ultrasound domain lacks a comprehensive solution capable of bridging low-level Ultrasound Grounded Perception (e.g., segmentation, localization) and high-level Ultrasound Comprehensive Interpretation (e.g., diagnosis, reasoning). To bridge this gap, we propose UMind-VL, a unified foundation model designed to synergize pixel-level structural understanding with complex clinical reasoning. We first introduce UMind-DS, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 1.2 million ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions, enriching standard data with pixel-level annotations and clinician-validated rationales. Architecturally, UMind-VL incorporates a lightweight Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs. This design, combined with task-specific tokens, unifies segmentation, detection, geometric measurement, and diagnosis tasks within a single framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with, or superior to, state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability. We demonstrate the capability of UMind-VL in Figure 1.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统性地研究了3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）水印方案的脆弱性，提出首个专用于3DGS的水印净化框架GSPure，通过分析视图依赖渲染贡献和几何特征聚类，精准移除水印高斯图元，在大幅降低水印强度的同时几乎不损害原始场景质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯水印方法是否真正能保障3D资产的版权保护尚不明确；同时，传统2D图像水印去除技术难以有效迁移到3DGS场景，因其具有独特的渲染流程和高斯图元属性。

Method: 提出GSPure框架，通过分析视图相关的渲染贡献并利用几何精确的特征聚类，精准识别并移除与水印相关的高斯图元，同时保留原始场景完整性。

Result: 实验表明，GSPure在水印净化性能上最优，可将水印PSNR降低最多16.34dB，同时对原始场景保真度影响极小（PSNR损失小于1dB），且在效果和泛化能力上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GSPure是首个面向3DGS水印的有效净化方法，揭示了当前3D高斯水印方案的安全隐患，并为未来鲁棒水印设计提供了重要参考。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for 3D scenes, widely adopted due to its exceptional efficiency and high-fidelity visual quality. Given the significant value of 3DGS assets, recent works have introduced specialized watermarking schemes to ensure copyright protection and ownership verification. However, can existing 3D Gaussian watermarking approaches genuinely guarantee robust protection of the 3D assets? In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore and validate possible vulnerabilities of 3DGS watermarking frameworks. We demonstrate that conventional watermark removal techniques designed for 2D images do not effectively generalize to the 3DGS scenario due to the specialized rendering pipeline and unique attributes of each gaussian primitives. Motivated by this insight, we propose GSPure, the first watermark purification framework specifically for 3DGS watermarking representations. By analyzing view-dependent rendering contributions and exploiting geometrically accurate feature clustering, GSPure precisely isolates and effectively removes watermark-related Gaussian primitives while preserving scene integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GSPure achieves the best watermark purification performance, reducing watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB while minimizing degradation to original scene fidelity with less than 1dB PSNR loss. Moreover, it consistently outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and generalization.

*Xiaosong Jia,Yanhao Liu,Junqi You,Renqiu Xia,Yu Hong,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出DriveVGGT，一种面向自动驾驶场景的尺度感知4D重建框架，在VGGT基础上引入时序视频注意力（TVA）和多相机一致性注意力（MCA）模块，并增加绝对尺度与自车位姿预测头，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将通用的前馈重建模型VGGT直接用于自动驾驶系统效果不佳，因为自动驾驶具有独特的先验条件，如相机视图重叠小、内外参已知、相机相对位置固定等，需专门设计模型以融合这些先验。

Method: 提出DriveVGGT框架：1）使用TVA模块独立处理多相机视频，利用单相机序列内的时空连续性；2）设计MCA模块，通过归一化相对位姿嵌入进行窗口注意力，建立跨相机一致性并限制注意力范围；3）在VGGT头部增加绝对尺度头和自车位姿头。

Result: 在自动驾驶数据集上，DriveVGGT性能优于VGGT、StreamVGGT和fastVGGT，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: DriveVGGT通过显式建模自动驾驶特有的几何与运动先验，有效提升了前馈式4D重建在该场景下的性能，为自动驾驶感知提供了更优的重建方案。

Abstract: Feed-forward reconstruction has recently gained significant attention, with VGGT being a notable example. However, directly applying VGGT to autonomous driving (AD) systems leads to sub-optimal results due to the different priors between the two tasks. In AD systems, several important new priors need to be considered: (i) The overlap between camera views is minimal, as autonomous driving sensor setups are designed to achieve coverage at a low cost. (ii) The camera intrinsics and extrinsics are known, which introduces more constraints on the output and also enables the estimation of absolute scale. (iii) Relative positions of all cameras remain fixed though the ego vehicle is in motion. To fully integrate these priors into a feed-forward framework, we propose DriveVGGT, a scale-aware 4D reconstruction framework specifically designed for autonomous driving data. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Video Attention (TVA) module to process multi-camera videos independently, which better leverages the spatiotemporal continuity within each single-camera sequence. Then, we propose a Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) module to conduct window attention with normalized relative pose embeddings, aiming to establish consistency relationships across different cameras while restricting each token to attend only to nearby frames. Finally, we extend the standard VGGT heads by adding an absolute scale head and an ego vehicle pose head. Experiments show that DriveVGGT outperforms VGGT, StreamVGGT, fastVGGT on autonomous driving dataset while extensive ablation studies verify effectiveness of the proposed designs.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于语言和分割语义引导的自动视频上色方法，利用扩散模型结合光流时序传播与校正机制，在无需人工指定颜色的情况下实现高质量、时序稳定的视频上色，并在多个指标上达到当前最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频上色方法存在时间闪烁问题或需要大量人工输入，难以兼顾自动化与视觉质量。

Method: 采用语言条件扩散模型对灰度帧进行上色，通过自动生成的对象掩码和通用文本提示提供语义引导；利用RAFT光流从前一帧传播颜色信息以保证时序一致性，并引入校正步骤修复光流引入的不一致。

Result: 在DAVIS30和VIDEVO20基准上，该方法在PSNR、Colorfulness和CDC等指标上均达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: 所提方法证明了基于自动提示的语义引导能有效实现高保真、时序一致的视频自动上色。

Abstract: Existing video colorization methods struggle with temporal flickering or demand extensive manual input. We propose a novel approach automating high-fidelity video colorization using rich semantic guidance derived from language and segmentation. We employ a language-conditioned diffusion model to colorize grayscale frames. Guidance is provided via automatically generated object masks and textual prompts; our primary automatic method uses a generic prompt, achieving state-of-the-art results without specific color input. Temporal stability is achieved by warping color information from previous frames using optical flow (RAFT); a correction step detects and fixes inconsistencies introduced by warping. Evaluations on standard benchmarks (DAVIS30, VIDEVO20) show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in colorization accuracy (PSNR) and visual realism (Colorfulness, CDC), demonstrating the efficacy of automated prompt-based guidance for consistent video colorization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出“patch collapse”概念，即观察图像中某些图像块会降低其余图像块的不确定性，并通过学习一个自动编码器来识别在重建目标区域时最依赖的图像块。利用PageRank对这些依赖关系进行排序，可获得最优的图像块观测顺序。遵循该顺序能提升多种掩码图像建模方法的性能，包括自回归图像生成和仅使用高排名图像块的图像分类，在仅使用22%关键图像块的情况下即可实现高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像建模方法未充分考虑图像块之间的依赖关系及其对整体表示效率的影响。作者受量子力学中波函数坍缩的启发，旨在探索一种新的图像建模视角——“patch collapse”，以提高视觉任务的效率。

Method: 作者设计了一个自动编码器，能够软选择一部分图像块来重建每个目标图像块，从而学习图像块之间的依赖关系。接着，通过计算每个图像块依赖图的PageRank得分，确定最优的图像块观测顺序。

Result: 实验表明，遵循所提出的patch collapse顺序可以提升自回归图像生成模型MAR的性能；在图像分类任务中，Vision Transformer仅使用22%的高PageRank得分图像块即可达到高准确率。

Conclusion: “Patch collapse”提供了一种新颖且高效的图像建模范式，通过识别和优先处理信息量最大的图像块，显著提升了多种视觉任务的效率与性能。

Abstract: Observing certain patches in an image reduces the uncertainty of others. Their realization lowers the distribution entropy of each remaining patch feature, analogous to collapsing a particle's wave function in quantum mechanics. This phenomenon can intuitively be called patch collapse. To identify which patches are most relied on during a target region's collapse, we learn an autoencoder that softly selects a subset of patches to reconstruct each target patch. Graphing these learned dependencies for each patch's PageRank score reveals the optimal patch order to realize an image. We show that respecting this order benefits various masked image modeling methods. First, autoregressive image generation can be boosted by retraining the state-of-the-art model MAR. Next, we introduce a new setup for image classification by exposing Vision Transformers only to high-rank patches in the collapse order. Seeing 22\% of such patches is sufficient to achieve high accuracy. With these experiments, we propose patch collapse as a novel image modeling perspective that promotes vision efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RS-EoT的远程感知证据思维范式，通过SocraticAgent多智能体系统和两阶段强化学习策略，有效缓解了现有视觉语言模型在遥感任务中的“一瞥效应”，实现了基于视觉证据的真实推理，并在多个遥感VQA和定位基准上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前受DeepSeek-R1启发的多模态推理模型在遥感任务中普遍存在伪推理问题，即模型仅叙述推理过程而未真正依据视觉证据进行推理。作者将此归因于“一瞥效应”——对大尺度遥感图像的一次性粗略感知导致理解不完整，转而依赖语言自洽性而非视觉证据。

Method: 提出RS-EoT（Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought）范式，采用SocraticAgent自博弈多智能体系统，通过交替进行推理与视觉检查来合成推理轨迹；并设计两阶段渐进式强化学习策略：先在细粒度定位任务上训练以增强RS-EoT能力，再在遥感VQA任务上泛化。

Result: 实验表明RS-EoT在多个遥感VQA和定位基准上取得最先进性能，分析显示其推理过程呈现清晰的迭代循环，证实该方法有效缓解了“一瞥效应”，实现了基于证据的真实推理。

Conclusion: RS-EoT通过引入语言驱动的迭代视觉证据搜寻机制，显著提升了遥感场景下多模态模型的真实推理能力，为解决遥感视觉语言任务中的伪推理问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent multimodal reasoning models, inspired by DeepSeek-R1, have significantly advanced vision-language systems. However, in remote sensing (RS) tasks, we observe widespread pseudo reasoning: models narrate the process of reasoning rather than genuinely reason toward the correct answer based on visual evidence. We attribute this to the Glance Effect, where a single, coarse perception of large-scale RS imagery results in incomplete understanding and reasoning based on linguistic self-consistency instead of visual evidence. To address this, we propose RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven, iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. To instill this paradigm, we propose SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. To enhance and generalize these patterns, we propose a two-stage progressive RL strategy: first, RL on fine-grained Grounding tasks to enhance RS-EoT capabilities, followed by RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader understanding scenarios. Experiments show RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks. Analyses reveal clear iterative cycles of reasoning and evidence seeking, confirming RS-EoT mitigates the Glance Effect and enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning.

TL;DR: Match-and-Fuse 是一种无需训练的零样本方法，用于在图像集合中实现一致性的可控生成，通过图结构建模和特征融合，在不依赖掩码或人工监督的情况下保持跨图像的一致性与整体连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对单张图像或密集采样的视频进行生成，难以在非结构化的图像集合（如不同视角、时间、背景但共享视觉元素的图像）中保持跨图像的一致性。因此，作者提出一种新的 set-to-set 生成框架以解决这一问题。

Method: 将图像集合建模为图结构，每个节点是一张图像，每条边触发一对图像的联合生成；通过密集对应关系引导图像对之间的内部特征融合，利用文生图模型中多视图共享画布时的自然一致性先验，实现局部一致性和全局连贯性。

Result: Match-and-Fuse 在一致性和视觉质量方面达到当前最优水平，并支持从图像集合中进行新颖的内容创作。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、不依赖人工标注，有效实现了非结构化图像集的一致性可控生成，拓展了图像生成模型在集合级任务中的应用能力。

Abstract: We present Match-and-Fuse - a zero-shot, training-free method for consistent controlled generation of unstructured image sets - collections that share a common visual element, yet differ in viewpoint, time of capture, and surrounding content. Unlike existing methods that operate on individual images or densely sampled videos, our framework performs set-to-set generation: given a source set and user prompts, it produces a new set that preserves cross-image consistency of shared content. Our key idea is to model the task as a graph, where each node corresponds to an image and each edge triggers a joint generation of image pairs. This formulation consolidates all pairwise generations into a unified framework, enforcing their local consistency while ensuring global coherence across the entire set. This is achieved by fusing internal features across image pairs, guided by dense input correspondences, without requiring masks or manual supervision. It also allows us to leverage an emergent prior in text-to-image models that encourages coherent generation when multiple views share a single canvas. Match-and-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art consistency and visual quality, and unlocks new capabilities for content creation from image collections.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档视觉问答（DocVQA）系统在准确率与效率之间存在明显权衡：大模型虽具强定位能力但部署成本高，而小型模型则在定位性能上显著下降。

Method: 提出DocVAL框架，包含三个核心组件：(1) 利用验证阶段文本检测对教师监督信号进行过滤去噪；(2) 多模块验证器（VAL）确保答案正确性与几何一致性，并提供像素级细粒度错误反馈；(3) 两阶段学生训练策略，先从经验证的思维链（CoT）轨迹学习，再通过VAL反馈进行迭代优化。

Result: 所提学生模型（Gemma-3 12B）在DocVQA上达到91.4% ANLS和82.4% mAP，且推理时无需OCR或文本检测；消融实验证明验证反馈带来6.3 mAP提升，迭代优化贡献9.7 mAP增益；同时发布了95k条高质量验证CoT轨迹。

Conclusion: DocVAL有效提升了轻量级视觉语言模型在文档理解中的空间推理能力，兼顾性能与部署效率，为相关研究提供了新范式和数据资源。

Abstract: Document visual question answering (DocVQA) requires models to jointly reason over textual content and spatial layout, yet current systems exhibit a sharp accuracy--efficiency trade-off: large teacher models achieve strong grounding but are too expensive for deployment, while compact students suffer substantial drops in localization performance. We propose DocVAL, a validated chain-of-thought distillation framework that transfers the spatial reasoning ability of a large teacher into a deployable student VLM through three key components: (1) teacher supervision with validation-time text detection to filter and denoise training signals, (2) a multi-module validator (VAL) that enforces answer correctness and geometric consistency while producing fine-grained, pixel-level error feedback, and (3) a two-stage student training scheme that first learns from validated CoT traces and then undergoes iterative refinement driven by VAL feedback. Our student (Gemma-3 12B) achieves 91.4\% ANLS and 82.4\% mAP on DocVQA as a pure VLM requiring no text detection or OCR at inference. Extensive ablations demonstrate that validated feedback contributes 6.3 mAP gain and iterative refinement accounts for 9.7 mAP improvement. We release 95k high-quality, validator-verified CoT traces to advance spatial reasoning research in document understanding.

TL;DR: 本文提出多视图掩码自编码器（MVMAE）及其文本增强版本MVMAE-V2T，利用放射影像的多视图结构和报告文本进行自监督预训练，在多个胸部X光数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建鲁棒的医学机器学习系统需要能有效利用临床数据内在结构的预训练策略。当前方法往往未能充分利用放射学研究中天然存在的多视图冗余以及伴随的文本报告信息。

Method: 提出MVMAE框架，结合掩码图像重建与跨视图对齐，从多视图影像中学习视图不变且疾病相关的表征；进一步引入MVMAE-V2T，将放射学报告作为辅助文本信号以增强语义基础，同时保持纯视觉推理能力。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR、CheXpert和PadChest三个大型公开数据集的下游疾病分类任务中，MVMAE一致优于监督学习和视觉-语言基线模型；MVMAE-V2T在标签稀缺场景下带来额外性能提升。

Conclusion: 结构化（多视图）与文本监督是构建可扩展、临床落地的医学基础模型的互补且关键路径。

Abstract: Building robust medical machine learning systems requires pretraining strategies that exploit the intrinsic structure present in clinical data. We introduce Multiview Masked Autoencoder (MVMAE), a self-supervised framework that leverages the natural multi-view organization of radiology studies to learn view-invariant and disease-relevant representations. MVMAE combines masked image reconstruction with cross-view alignment, transforming clinical redundancy across projections into a powerful self-supervisory signal. We further extend this approach with MVMAE-V2T, which incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal to enhance semantic grounding while preserving fully vision-based inference. Evaluated on a downstream disease classification task on three large-scale public datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest, MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines. Furthermore, MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, particularly in low-label regimes where structured textual supervision is most beneficial. Together, these results establish the importance of structural and textual supervision as complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently attracted growing attention in end-to-end autonomous driving for their strong reasoning capabilities and rich world knowledge. However, existing VLAs often suffer from limited numerical reasoning ability and overly simplified input-output mappings, which hinder their performance in complex driving scenarios requiring step-by-step causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose CoT4AD, a novel VLA framework that introduces Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for autonomous driving to enhance both numerical and causal reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). CoT4AD integrates visual observations and language instructions to perform semantic reasoning, scene understanding, and trajectory planning. During training, it explicitly models a perception-question-prediction-action CoT to align the reasoning space with the action space across multiple driving tasks. During inference, it performs implicit CoT reasoning to enable consistent numerical reasoning and robust decision-making in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated benchmarks, including nuScenes and Bench2Drive, demonstrate that CoT4AD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于Swin Transformer的改进型检测头（neck）结构，用于提升稀疏小目标（如鸟类）的检测性能，通过调整窗口大小并在CenterNet框架下实现更优的小目标检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前小目标检测方法主要针对密集场景（如人群或遥感图像中的远距离物体），但在目标稀疏且样本不足的情况下难以有效学习特征，因此需要专门针对稀疏小目标（如鸟类）设计新方法。

Method: 在CenterNet框架中引入基于Swin Transformer的neck结构，采用分层设计增强特征学习能力，并调整Swin Transformer的移位窗口大小以适应小目标检测需求。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的Swin Transformer-based neck结合CenterNet能显著提升小目标检测性能，且较小的窗口尺寸（如默认值2）有助于提高小目标的mAP。

Conclusion: 针对稀疏小目标（如鸟类）检测问题，通过优化neck结构并调整Swin Transformer窗口大小，可有效提升检测精度，为小目标检测提供了一种可行的新思路。

Abstract: Object detection is the task of detecting objects in an image. In this task, the detection of small objects is particularly difficult. Other than the small size, it is also accompanied by difficulties due to blur, occlusion, and so on. Current small object detection methods are tailored to small and dense situations, such as pedestrians in a crowd or far objects in remote sensing scenarios. However, when the target object is small and sparse, there is a lack of objects available for training, making it more difficult to learn effective features. In this paper, we propose a specialized method for detecting a specific category of small objects; birds. Particularly, we improve the features learned by the neck; the sub-network between the backbone and the prediction head, to learn more effective features with a hierarchical design. We employ Swin Transformer to upsample the image features. Moreover, we change the shifted window size for adapting to small objects. Experiments show that the proposed Swin Transformer-based neck combined with CenterNet can lead to good performance by changing the window sizes. We further find that smaller window sizes (default 2) benefit mAPs for small object detection.

*Yifan Du,Kun Zhou,Yingqian Min,Yue Ling,Wayne Xin Zhao,Youbin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了不同思维链（CoT）设计对视觉语言模型（VLMs）泛化视觉推理能力的影响，发现在受控迷宫任务中，简洁且仅包含关键定位步骤的CoT比冗长或视觉化的CoT更具泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CoT数据（尤其是长CoT或“用图像思考”等视觉CoT）被广泛用于监督中间推理过程，但尚不清楚哪些CoT设计真正有助于提升模型在视觉推理任务中的泛化能力。

Method: 作者构建了一个可控的迷宫求解基准任务，其中推理规则完全基于视觉、难度可通过网格大小调节、中间步骤可自动生成；使用Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型，在标准SFT+RL训练流程下，比较三种CoT格式：语言CoT、定位CoT（含空间坐标轨迹）和视觉CoT（含图像操作）。

Result: 实验表明：视觉化或更长的CoT主要加速收敛但不提升最终性能上限；仅包含必要定位步骤的简洁CoT优于冗长推理轨迹；最简定位CoT在不同迷宫尺寸上泛化效果最佳。这些结论在其他视觉中心任务中也得到验证。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了“短即是长”的效应，为构建更具泛化能力的视觉推理SFT数据集提供了实用指导。

Abstract: We study how different Chain-of-Thought (CoT) designs affect the acquisition of the generalizable visual reasoning ability in vision-language models (VLMs). While CoT data, especially long or visual CoT such as "think with image", has been widely used to supervise intermediate reasoning, it remains unclear why specific CoT designs help and which ones truly support generalizable reasoning. To systematically evaluate this, we focus on a controlled maze-solving benchmark where reasoning rules are fully visual, difficulty can be tuned by grid size, and all the intermediate steps can be automatically generated. Using Qwen2.5-VL-7B under a standard SFT-then-RL pipeline, we compare three representative CoT formats: Language CoT, Grounding CoT (with spatial coordinate trajectories), and Visual CoT (with image manipulations). Our experiments reveal that visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but do not lift the final performance ceiling; concise CoT containing only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; and, strikingly, CoT retaining only the minimal grounding results generalizes best across different maze sizes. We further validate these insights on other vision-centric tasks. These findings highlight a "short is long" effect and provide practical guidance for constructing more generalizable SFT datasets for visual reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出HarmoCLIP，通过引入显式的细粒度语义监督和区域-语言对齐策略，在不损害全局语义一致性的前提下提升CLIP模型的局部感知能力，有效缓解了全局与局部表征之间的权衡问题，并在检索和区域分类任务上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP缺乏区域级监督，导致细粒度语义理解能力有限；现有方法在增强局部感知的同时会破坏全局对齐，存在全局-局部表征之间的权衡问题。

Method: HarmoCLIP引入显式的细粒度语义监督项，直接对齐文本片段与其对应的视觉区域，并设计一种新的区域-语言对齐监督策略，在加强局部表征能力的同时保持全局语义一致性。

Result: 在全局检索任务上性能提升最高达69.78%，在区域边界框分类任务的Top-1准确率上提升3.2%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HarmoCLIP有效解决了CLIP中全局与局部语义表征之间的权衡问题，提供了一种平衡、高效且即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated remarkable generalization ability and strong performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the lack of region-level supervision, CLIP exhibits limited fine-grained semantic understanding. Although several methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they unintentionally disrupt the global alignment, resulting in a persistent trade-off where improving local perception simultaneously degrades global coherence. In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

*Fabio Rosenthal,Sebastian Schmidt,Thorsten Graf,Thorsten Bagodonat,Stephan Günnemann,Leo Schwinn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文发现多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在多项选择视觉问答（VQA）任务中对提示格式的微小变化极为敏感，即使这些变化在语义上是中性的，也会显著影响评估结果，并且现有偏见缓解策略无法解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对MLLMs的评估主要依赖多项选择VQA任务，但已有研究表明此类评估易受选项顺序等偏见影响。作者旨在揭示并分析此前未被探索的提示格式偏见，以质疑现有评估方法的可靠性。

Method: 作者识别出提示格式中的三个关键变异因素，在七种MLLMs和五种VQA数据集上进行了大规模实验，共涵盖48种不同的提示格式变体，系统评估这些格式变化对模型性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，多项选择VQA对提示格式的细微变化高度敏感；这种敏感性独立于已知的选项顺序偏见和模型对正确答案的置信度；现有偏见缓解方法无法有效应对这类新发现的提示格式偏见。

Conclusion: 当前基于多项选择VQA的MLLM评估方法存在严重且未被充分认识的提示格式偏见，亟需开发新的评估范式或更鲁棒的偏见缓解策略以确保评估结果的可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in handling image-text inputs. A common way to assess this ability is through multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA). Earlier works have already revealed that these benchmarks are sensitive to answer choice order, a limitation that can be mitigated through careful design. Yet, we highlight additional, unexplored biases in prompt formatting that question the reliability of current MLLM evaluations. Specifically, we identify three key variation factors in prompt formatting and analyze their impact through a large-scale study involving $\mathbf{\text{seven}}$ MLLMs and $\mathbf{\text{five}}$ VQA datasets, spanning $\mathbf{48}$ distinct $\mathbf{\text{prompt format variations}}$. Our findings reveal that multiple-choice VQA is highly sensitive to minor prompt format changes, even when these changes are semantically neutral. We further demonstrate that these biases persist independently of known order biases or the MLLM's confidence in the correct answer. Finally, we demonstrate that existing bias mitigation strategies fail to address these newly identified biases.

Abstract: Eye tracking has become increasingly important in virtual and augmented reality applications; however, the current gaze accuracy falls short of meeting the requirements for spatial computing. We designed a gaze collection framework and utilized high-precision equipment to gather the first precise benchmark dataset, GazeTrack, encompassing diverse ethnicities, ages, and visual acuity conditions for pupil localization and gaze tracking. We propose a novel shape error regularization method to constrain pupil ellipse fitting and train on open-source datasets, enhancing semantic segmentation and pupil position prediction accuracy. Additionally, we invent a novel coordinate transformation method similar to paper unfolding to accurately predict gaze vectors on the GazeTrack dataset. Finally, we built a gaze vector generation model that achieves reduced gaze angle error with lower computational complexity compared to other methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用归一化流（NFs）可逆性的新对齐策略，在生成过程中将中间特征与强大视觉基础模型的表示对齐，显著提升生成质量和分类准确率，并加速训练3.3倍以上，在ImageNet上取得NFs的新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准归一化流因对数似然优化导致语义表示不佳，限制了其生成质量，需改进其表示学习能力。

Method: 在生成（反向）过程中将中间特征与视觉基础模型的表示对齐，而非正则化前向过程；同时提出一种无需训练、测试时优化的分类算法以评估语义知识。

Result: 方法在ImageNet 64×64和256×256上取得归一化流的新SOTA，训练速度提升3.3倍以上，生成质量和分类准确率均显著提高。

Conclusion: 通过巧妙利用NFs的可逆性进行反向特征对齐，有效增强了语义表示，显著提升了NFs的生成与判别性能。

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are a class of generative models distinguished by a mathematically invertible architecture, where the forward pass transforms data into a latent space for density estimation, and the reverse pass generates new samples from this space. This characteristic creates an intrinsic synergy between representation learning and data generation. However, the generative quality of standard NFs is limited by poor semantic representations from log-likelihood optimization. To remedy this, we propose a novel alignment strategy that creatively leverages the invertibility of NFs: instead of regularizing the forward pass, we align the intermediate features of the generative (reverse) pass with representations from a powerful vision foundation model, demonstrating superior effectiveness over naive alignment. We also introduce a novel training-free, test-time optimization algorithm for classification, which provides a more intrinsic evaluation of the NF's embedded semantic knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the training of NFs by over 3.3$\times$, while simultaneously delivering significant improvements in both generative quality and classification accuracy. New state-of-the-art results for NFs are established on ImageNet 64$\times$64 and 256$\times$256. Our code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/FlowBack.

TL;DR: 本文提出ReAG，一种结合粗细粒度检索与批判模型的多模态RAG方法，通过强化学习提升知识密集型视觉问答中的推理能力，在Encyclopedic-VQA和InfoSeek上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在领域特定或知识密集型视觉问答任务中表现不佳，主要受限于预训练数据中相关知识的缺失；而现有的检索增强方法存在检索精度低、噪声多和推理能力有限的问题。

Method: ReAG方法融合粗粒度与细粒度检索，并引入一个批判模型过滤无关段落以确保高质量上下文；采用多阶段训练策略，先进行监督微调作为冷启动，再通过强化学习优化对检索内容的推理能力。

Result: 在Encyclopedic-VQA和InfoSeek两个知识型VQA基准上，ReAG显著优于现有方法，不仅提升了答案准确性，还实现了基于检索证据的可解释推理。

Conclusion: ReAG有效解决了知识密集型多模态问答中检索质量与推理能力不足的问题，为未来多模态检索增强生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in jointly understanding text, images, and videos, often evaluated via Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries, where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start. Extensive experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate that ReAG significantly outperforms prior methods, improving answer accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence.

TL;DR: 本文提出了INSIGHT，一种用于鲁棒检测和透明解释AI生成图像的多模态框架，即使在极低分辨率下也能有效工作，并通过可解释机制提升可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测方法在真实世界条件下（如下采样、压缩和跨域分布偏移）性能显著下降，且多数检测器缺乏可解释性，难以在高风险场景中获得信任和应用。

Method: INSIGHT结合了分层超分辨率以增强细微取证线索、Grad-CAM驱动的多尺度定位以揭示生成模式的空间区域，以及CLIP引导的语义对齐将视觉异常映射为人类可理解的描述；并通过结构化ReAct + 思维链提示视觉语言模型生成细粒度解释，再经双阶段G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge验证以确保事实性。

Result: 在动物、车辆和抽象合成场景等多个领域，INSIGHT在极端退化条件下显著优于现有检测器和黑盒视觉语言模型，在检测鲁棒性和解释质量方面均取得提升。

Conclusion: INSIGHT为透明、可靠的AI生成图像取证提供了实用路径，是迈向可信多模态内容验证的重要一步。

Abstract: The growing realism of AI-generated images produced by recent GAN and diffusion models has intensified concerns over the reliability of visual media. Yet, despite notable progress in deepfake detection, current forensic systems degrade sharply under real-world conditions such as severe downsampling, compression, and cross-domain distribution shifts. Moreover, most detectors operate as opaque classifiers, offering little insight into why an image is flagged as synthetic, undermining trust and hindering adoption in high-stakes settings.
  We introduce INSIGHT (Interpretable Neural Semantic and Image-based Generative-forensic Hallucination Tracing), a unified multimodal framework for robust detection and transparent explanation of AI-generated images, even at extremely low resolutions (16x16 - 64x64). INSIGHT combines hierarchical super-resolution for amplifying subtle forensic cues without inducing misleading artifacts, Grad-CAM driven multi-scale localization to reveal spatial regions indicative of generative patterns, and CLIP-guided semantic alignment to map visual anomalies to human-interpretable descriptors. A vision-language model is then prompted using a structured ReAct + Chain-of-Thought protocol to produce consistent, fine-grained explanations, verified through a dual-stage G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge pipeline to minimize hallucinations and ensure factuality.
  Across diverse domains, including animals, vehicles, and abstract synthetic scenes, INSIGHT substantially improves both detection robustness and explanation quality under extreme degradation, outperforming prior detectors and black-box VLM baselines. Our results highlight a practical path toward transparent, reliable AI-generated image forensics and establish INSIGHT as a step forward in trustworthy multimodal content verification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DIPT（Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning）的新方法，通过学习跨域不变的连续提示来提升病理图像视觉-语言模型在域泛化任务中的性能，显著提高了F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中存在因染色协议、扫描设备和成像设置差异引起的域偏移问题，而现有视觉-语言模型（如PLIP）在零样本设定下对提示敏感，且缺乏适用于组织病理学中心的语义描述符，难以定义有效的域特定提示。

Method: 提出DIPT方法，在知识蒸馏过程中为每个域学习多个输入token，并通过对各域token取平均获得域不变提示；学生模型利用这些提示从PLIP文本编码器中蒸馏知识，使视觉特征与域不变嵌入对齐。

Result: 在多个组织病理学数据集上，该方法相比现有最先进的知识蒸馏方法在域泛化任务中显著提升了平均F1分数。

Conclusion: DIPT有效增强了计算病理模型在多源异构临床数据下的泛化能力，有助于推动其在真实临床场景中的部署。

Abstract: Domain generalization is critical in computational pathology (CPath) due to inherent domain shifts caused by variations in staining protocols, scanner devices, and imaging settings across clinical centers. Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains. Our method adds a significant improvement in average F1-score to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge distillation approaches in domain generalization with histopathology datasets. This work helps the way of deploying robust CPath models in real-world clinical problems with heterogeneous data sources.

Conclusion: AnchorFlow 通过稳定潜在参考空间，有效提升了无需训练的 3D 编辑在语义表达和几何保真方面的性能。

Abstract: Training-free 3D editing aims to modify 3D shapes based on human instructions without model finetuning. It plays a crucial role in 3D content creation. However, existing approaches often struggle to produce strong or geometrically stable edits, largely due to inconsistent latent anchors introduced by timestep-dependent noise during diffusion sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorFlow, which is built upon the principle of latent anchor consistency. Specifically, AnchorFlow establishes a global latent anchor shared between the source and target trajectories, and enforces coherence using a relaxed anchor-alignment loss together with an anchor-aligned update rule. This design ensures that transformations remain stable and semantically faithful throughout the editing process. By stabilizing the latent reference space, AnchorFlow enables more pronounced semantic modifications. Moreover, AnchorFlow is mask-free. Without mask supervision, it effectively preserves geometric fidelity. Experiments on the Eval3DEdit benchmark show that AnchorFlow consistently delivers semantically aligned and structurally robust edits across diverse editing types.

Motivation: 开发一种能够合成高质量、解剖结构一致的双视角乳腺钼靶图像的方法，以支持医学影像数据增强，并探究第三通道的不同编码方式对图像质量和一致性的影响。

Method: 在包含11020例筛查钼靶图像的私有数据集上微调来自Hugging Face的预训练三通道DDPM，分别采用“求和”、“绝对差值”和“零通道”三种方式构建第三通道，生成500对合成图像。通过IoU、DSC、EMD和KS检验进行定量评估，并由非专家放射科医生进行视觉图灵测试以定性评估跨视角一致性和伪影。

Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to develop and evaluate a three channel denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for synthesizing single breast dual view mammograms and to assess the impact of channel representations on image fidelity and cross view consistency. Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar. Generated CC and MLO views maintained cross view consistency, with 6 to 8 percent of synthetic images exhibiting artifacts consistent with those in the training data. Conclusion: Three channel DDPMs can generate realistic and anatomically consistent dual view mammograms with promising applications in dataset augmentation.

Method: CORTEX框架包含三个模块：图像级变化检测器、基于视觉语言模型的推理感知文本提取模块（RTE）和图文双重对齐模块（ITDA），联合利用像素级差异与场景级文本知识进行细粒度关系推理。

Result: CORTEX能够结合视觉与文本特征进行推理，有效识别仅靠视觉特征难以察觉的变化。

Conclusion: 通过整合视觉语言模型提供的文本信息，CORTEX显著提升了变化描述任务中对组合语义和对象关系的理解能力。

Abstract: Change captioning aims to describe changes between a pair of images. However, existing works rely on visual features alone, which often fail to capture subtle but meaningful changes because they lack the ability to represent explicitly structured information such as object relationships and compositional semantics. To alleviate this, we present CORTEX (COmpositional Reasoning-aware TEXt-guided), a novel framework that integrates complementary textual cues to enhance change understanding. In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning. CORTEX consists of three key modules: (i) an Image-level Change Detector that identifies low-level visual differences between paired images, (ii) a Reasoning-aware Text Extraction (RTE) module that use VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions implicit in visual features, and (iii) an Image-Text Dual Alignment (ITDA) module that aligns visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning. This enables CORTEX to reason over visual and textual features and capture changes that are otherwise ambiguous in visual features alone.

*Furkan Guzelant,Arda Goktogan,Tarık Kaya,Aysegul Dundar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出DiffStyle360，一种基于扩散模型的3D头部风格化方法，仅需一张风格参考图即可在无需逐风格训练的情况下生成多视角一致、身份保留的3D风格化头像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D头部风格化方法通常依赖计算成本高昂的优化或针对特定领域的微调，难以高效适应新风格。

Method: 基于3D感知的DiffPortrait360架构，引入风格外观模块（解耦风格与内容）和风格融合注意力机制（在潜在空间中自适应平衡结构保留与风格保真度），并利用3D GAN生成的多视角数据集进行鲁棒微调，同时采用基于温度的键缩放策略控制推理时的风格化强度。

Result: 在FFHQ和RenderMe360上的大量实验表明，DiffStyle360在多种挑战性风格域中优于当前最先进的GAN和扩散模型风格化方法，实现了更优的风格质量。

Conclusion: DiffStyle360有效解决了现有方法对昂贵优化或特定领域微调的依赖，实现了高效、高质量、多视角一致且身份保留的3D头部风格化。

Abstract: 3D head stylization has emerged as a key technique for reimagining realistic human heads in various artistic forms, enabling expressive character design and creative visual experiences in digital media. Despite the progress in 3D-aware generation, existing 3D head stylization methods often rely on computationally expensive optimization or domain-specific fine-tuning to adapt to new styles. To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle360, a diffusion-based framework capable of producing multi-view consistent, identity-preserving 3D head stylizations across diverse artistic domains given a single style reference image, without requiring per-style training. Building upon the 3D-aware DiffPortrait360 architecture, our approach introduces two key components: the Style Appearance Module, which disentangles style from content, and the Style Fusion Attention mechanism, which adaptively balances structure preservation and stylization fidelity in the latent space. Furthermore, we employ a 3D GAN-generated multi-view dataset for robust fine-tuning and introduce a temperaturebased key scaling strategy to control stylization intensity during inference. Extensive experiments on FFHQ and RenderMe360 demonstrate that DiffStyle360 achieves superior style quality, outperforming state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion-based stylization methods across challenging style domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ovis-Image 是一个7B参数的文本到图像模型，在有限计算资源下实现了高质量文本渲染，性能媲美更大规模开源模型并接近闭源系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在文本渲染方面存在不足，且大型模型难以在单GPU上高效部署；因此需要一个兼顾文本渲染质量与部署效率的紧凑模型。

Method: 基于 Ovis-U1 框架，结合扩散式视觉解码器与更强的 Ovis 2.5 多模态主干，并采用以文本为中心的训练流程，包括大规模预训练和针对性后训练优化。

Result: Ovis-Image 在双语文本渲染任务中表现优异，性能与 Qwen-Image 相当，并接近 Seedream 和 GPT4o 等闭源系统，同时可在单张高端 GPU 上高效运行。

Conclusion: 通过强大多模态主干与精心设计的文本导向训练策略，可在不依赖大模型或专有技术的前提下实现可靠的高质量文本渲染。

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{Ovis-Image}$, a 7B text-to-image model specifically optimized for high-quality text rendering, designed to operate efficiently under stringent computational constraints. Built upon our previous Ovis-U1 framework, Ovis-Image integrates a diffusion-based visual decoder with the stronger Ovis 2.5 multimodal backbone, leveraging a text-centric training pipeline that combines large-scale pre-training with carefully tailored post-training refinements. Despite its compact architecture, Ovis-Image achieves text rendering performance on par with significantly larger open models such as Qwen-Image and approaches closed-source systems like Seedream and GPT4o. Crucially, the model remains deployable on a single high-end GPU with moderate memory, narrowing the gap between frontier-level text rendering and practical deployment. Our results indicate that combining a strong multimodal backbone with a carefully designed, text-focused training recipe is sufficient to achieve reliable bilingual text rendering without resorting to oversized or proprietary models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WUKONG 是一种无需训练的高保真纹理3D变形框架，利用基于流的Transformer生成先验，通过最优传输重心问题建模实现平滑形状过渡，并引入语义一致性机制保留高频纹理细节，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D变形方法依赖人工对应匹配和变形轨迹估计，泛化能力有限且需昂贵预处理；WUKONG旨在克服这些限制，实现自动、高质量的3D形态与纹理过渡。

Method: WUKONG利用基于流的Transformer的生成先验，将变形建模为最优传输重心问题以确保形状连续性；采用顺序初始化策略避免几何突变，并设计相似性引导的语义一致性机制保留高频纹理细节。

Result: 大量实验表明，WUKONG在几何和纹理多样性上均显著优于当前最先进方法，能生成高保真、细节丰富的3D过渡效果。

Conclusion: WUKONG提供了一种高效、无需训练的3D纹理变形方案，在保持语义一致性和细节保真度方面表现卓越，为高保真3D内容生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present WUKONG, a novel training-free framework for high-fidelity textured 3D morphing that takes a pair of source and target prompts (image or text) as input. Unlike conventional methods -- which rely on manual correspondence matching and deformation trajectory estimation (limiting generalization and requiring costly preprocessing) -- WUKONG leverages the generative prior of flow-based transformers to produce high-fidelity 3D transitions with rich texture details. To ensure smooth shape transitions, we exploit the inherent continuity of flow-based generative processes and formulate morphing as an optimal transport barycenter problem. We further introduce a sequential initialization strategy to prevent abrupt geometric distortions and preserve identity coherence. For faithful texture preservation, we propose a similarity-guided semantic consistency mechanism that selectively retains high-frequency details and enables precise control over blending dynamics. This avoids common artifacts like oversmoothing while maintaining semantic fidelity. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that WUKONG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior results across diverse geometry and texture variations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIMM-X 是一个用于医疗图像分析的新框架，通过最小化多个虚假相关性与因果特征之间的互信息，有效缓解了深度学习模型中的捷径学习问题，提升了模型在新环境中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中常存在多种虚假相关性（捷径学习），导致深度学习模型在新环境中泛化能力差，甚至引发严重误诊，因此需要一种方法来解耦因果特征与这些虚假因素。

Method: 提出 MIMM-X 框架，通过最小化多个虚假相关性与因果特征之间的互信息，使模型基于真正的因果关系进行预测。

Result: 在 UK Biobank、NAKO 和 CheXpert 三个数据集（涵盖 MRI 和 X 光两种模态）上的实验表明，MIMM-X 能有效缓解多种虚假相关性带来的捷径学习问题。

Conclusion: MIMM-X 能提升医学影像模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，使其更依赖于真实的因果特征而非数据集特定的捷径。

Abstract: Deep learning models can excel on medical tasks, yet often experience spurious correlations, known as shortcut learning, leading to poor generalization in new environments. Particularly in medical imaging, where multiple spurious correlations can coexist, misclassifications can have severe consequences. We propose MIMM-X, a framework that disentangles causal features from multiple spurious correlations by minimizing their mutual information. It enables predictions based on true underlying causal relationships rather than dataset-specific shortcuts. We evaluate MIMM-X on three datasets (UK Biobank, NAKO, CheXpert) across two imaging modalities (MRI and X-ray). Results demonstrate that MIMM-X effectively mitigates shortcut learning of multiple spurious correlations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fin3R 是一种轻量级微调方法，通过冻结解码器并仅微调图像编码器，利用单目教师模型从大规模无标签数据中蒸馏精细几何细节，显著提升前馈式3D重建模型的几何精度与鲁棒性，且几乎不增加推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前馈式3D重建模型在精细几何结构和鲁棒性方面表现不佳，主要受限于高质量深度与位姿监督数据稀缺，以及多视角点图回归中存在的固有几何错位问题。

Method: Fin3R 在保持原有模型结构不变的前提下，冻结负责视图匹配的解码器，仅对图像编码器进行微调；通过一个轻量级 LoRA 适配器，将来自强大单目教师模型的精细几何信息从大规模无标签数据中蒸馏到编码器中。

Result: 在 DUSt3R、MASt3R、CUT3R 和 VGGT 等多种模型上验证表明，Fin3R 微调后的模型在单视图和多视图设置下均能生成更清晰的边界、恢复更复杂的结构，并显著提升几何精度，同时仅引入极小的 LoRA 参数，几乎不影响测试时的内存占用和延迟。

Conclusion: Fin3R 是一种简单、有效且通用的微调策略，能够显著增强前馈式3D重建模型的性能，适用于多种现有架构，在不牺牲推理效率的前提下提升重建质量。

Abstract: We present Fin3R, a simple, effective, and general fine-tuning method for feed-forward 3D reconstruction models. The family of feed-forward reconstruction model regresses pointmap of all input images to a reference frame coordinate system, along with other auxiliary outputs, in a single forward pass. However, we find that current models struggle with fine geometry and robustness due to (\textit{i}) the scarcity of high-fidelity depth and pose supervision and (\textit{ii}) the inherent geometric misalignment from multi-view pointmap regression. Fin3R jointly tackles two issues with an extra lightweight fine-tuning step. We freeze the decoder, which handles view matching, and fine-tune only the image encoder-the component dedicated to feature extraction. The encoder is enriched with fine geometric details distilled from a strong monocular teacher model on large, unlabeled datasets, using a custom, lightweight LoRA adapter. We validate our method on a wide range of models, including DUSt3R, MASt3R, CUT3R, and VGGT. The fine-tuned models consistently deliver sharper boundaries, recover complex structures, and achieve higher geometric accuracy in both single- and multi-view settings, while adding only the tiny LoRA weights, which leave test-time memory and latency virtually unchanged.

*Changpeng Wang,Haozhe Wang,Xi Chen,Junhan Liu,Taofeng Xue,Chong Peng,Donglian Qi,Fangzhen Lin,Yunfeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出视觉理性化（Visual Rationalization）概念，并引入视觉理由学习（ViRL）框架，通过端到端强化学习将视觉动作作为核心推理原语，从而提升视觉语言模型的可解释性、准确性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言推理方法将视觉动作视为可选工具，导致模型看似基于图像思考，实则依赖与上下文无关的动作，无法真正实现视觉引导的推理，产生“图像思考幻觉”。

Method: 提出视觉理由学习（ViRL）范式，包含三个关键组件：(1) 基于真实视觉理由的过程监督；(2) 通过步骤级奖励塑形实现目标对齐；(3) 细粒度信用分配机制以区分正确、冗余和错误的视觉动作。

Result: ViRL在感知、幻觉和推理等多个基准上取得最先进性能，且仅通过端到端强化学习训练。

Conclusion: 视觉理性化是一种任务无关、过程驱动的新范式，有助于构建透明、可验证且可信的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language reasoning underscore the importance of thinking with images, where models actively ground their reasoning in visual evidence. Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to "get the right answer for the right visual reason". Trained purely with end-to-end RL, ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning. This work establishes visual rationalization as a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SkeletonAgent框架，通过Questioner和Selector两个协作智能体，将动作识别模型与大语言模型（LLM）动态连接，实现更精准的骨骼动作识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用大语言模型（LLM）提供语义先验时，通常将其与识别模型分离使用，缺乏性能反馈，难以提供区分相似动作所需的关键判别线索。

Method: 提出SkeletonAgent框架，包含Questioner和Selector两个智能体：Questioner识别最易混淆的动作类别并作为上下文提示LLM；Selector解析LLM响应，提取关节级约束反馈给识别器，实现细粒度跨模态对齐。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120、Kinetics-Skeleton、FineGYM和UAV-Human五个基准数据集上的实验表明，SkeletonAgent consistently优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过将识别模型与LLM以协作智能体方式耦合，SkeletonAgent有效提升了骨架动作识别的准确性和判别能力，为多模态协同学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in skeleton-based action recognition increasingly leverage semantic priors from Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich skeletal representations. However, the LLM is typically queried in isolation from the recognition model and receives no performance feedback. As a result, it often fails to deliver the targeted discriminative cues critical to distinguish similar actions. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkeletonAgent, a novel framework that bridges the recognition model and the LLM through two cooperative agents, i.e., Questioner and Selector. Specifically, the Questioner identifies the most frequently confused classes and supplies them to the LLM as context for more targeted guidance. Conversely, the Selector parses the LLM's response to extract precise joint-level constraints and feeds them back to the recognizer, enabling finer-grained cross-modal alignment. Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, and UAV-Human, demonstrate that SkeletonAgent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 尽管生成式基础模型能生成视觉上逼真的修复图像，但在儿科手部X光片上去除非解剖标记会显著降低骨龄和性别预测的AI性能，表明此类方法在临床应用前需进行严格的任务特异性验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估基于生成式模型的图像修复技术在去除医学影像中非解剖标记时，是否会影响下游临床任务（如骨龄和性别预测）的可靠性。

Method: 从RSNA骨龄挑战数据集中选取200张原始放射影像，使用gpt-image-1模型通过自然语言提示生成600张修复图像；利用深度学习集成模型评估骨龄估计（MAE）和性别分类（AUC）性能，并分析像素强度分布以检测结构变化。

Result: 修复后骨龄估计的MAE从6.26个月上升至30.11个月，性别分类AUC从0.955下降至0.704；修复图像出现像素强度偏移和不一致，表明存在未被校正的结构性改变。

Conclusion: 即使仅编辑非诊断区域，生成式模型的图像修复虽视觉逼真，却可能掩盖细微但具临床意义的特征并引入潜在偏差，因此在临床AI工作流中整合此类工具前必须进行严格的任务特定验证。

Abstract: Generative foundation models can remove visual artifacts through realistic image inpainting, but their impact on medical AI performance remains uncertain. Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本条件下，视觉-语言模型难以在正常与异常状态之间建立清晰边界，导致细微缺陷漏检或非典型正常样本被误拒。

Method: 提出统一框架ABounD，包含动态概念融合（DCF）模块生成类别自适应提示，以及对抗边界锻造（ABF）模块通过PGD风格扰动生成边界特征以精炼决策边界；整体采用单阶段训练，由概念-边界损失驱动。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上取得了少样本多类别异常检测的最先进性能。

Conclusion: ABounD通过协同优化语义对齐与决策边界，在数据稀缺场景下有效提升了异常检测的准确性与鲁棒性。

Abstract: Few-shot multi-class industrial anomaly detection remains a challenging task. Vision-language models need to be both category-adaptive and sharply discriminative, yet data scarcity often blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal states. This ambiguity leads to missed subtle defects and the rejection of atypical normal samples. We propose ABounD, an Adversarial Boundary-Driven few-shot learning for multi-class anomaly detection, which is a unified learning framework that integrates semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping. The Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) module produces class-adaptive prompts by fusing generalizable priors with class-specific cues, conditioned on image features. Meanwhile, Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) sculpts a more precise decision margin by generating boundary-level fence features via PGD-style perturbations. Training is conducted in a single stage under a Concept-Boundary Loss, where ABF provides the main supervisory signal and semantic-spatial regularizers stabilize the optimization. This synergy yields a decision boundary that closely follows normal data while preserving flexibility and robust semantic alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in the task of few-shot multi-class anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度语言的场景文本识别面临脚本多样性、非标准字体、书写风格差异以及缺乏高质量数据集和开源模型等挑战，亟需一个综合性基准数据集来推动相关研究。

Method: 构建了包含超过10万词、来自6500多张真实场景图像的BSTD数据集，并对其进行了精细标注，支持文本检测、脚本识别、裁剪词识别和端到端识别四项任务；同时对主流英文场景文本识别模型进行微调以适配印度语言。

Result: 实验结果揭示了当前模型在印度语言场景文本识别任务中的性能瓶颈与改进空间，验证了BSTD作为有效基准的价值。

Conclusion: BSTD数据集填补了印度语言场景文本识别领域的关键空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源，所有数据和模型均已开源。

Abstract: Reading scene text, that is, text appearing in images, has numerous application areas, including assistive technology, search, and e-commerce. Although scene text recognition in English has advanced significantly and is often considered nearly a solved problem, Indian language scene text recognition remains an open challenge. This is due to script diversity, non-standard fonts, and varying writing styles, and, more importantly, the lack of high-quality datasets and open-source models. To address these gaps, we introduce the Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD) - a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark for studying Indian Language Scene Text Recognition. It comprises more than 100K words that span 11 Indian languages and English, sourced from over 6,500 scene images captured across various linguistic regions of India. The dataset is meticulously annotated and supports multiple scene text tasks, including: (i) Scene Text Detection, (ii) Script Identification, (iii) Cropped Word Recognition, and (iv) End-to-End Scene Text Recognition. We evaluated state-of-the-art models originally developed for English by adapting (fine-tuning) them for Indian languages. Our results highlight the challenges and opportunities in Indian language scene text recognition. We believe that this dataset represents a significant step toward advancing research in this domain. All our models and data are open source.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SpaceMind，一种仅基于RGB输入、专为3D空间推理设计的多模态大语言模型，通过引入相机引导的模态融合机制，在多个空间推理基准上取得领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间推理任务（如距离估计、尺寸比较和跨视角一致性）上表现不足，而当前的3D感知方法要么依赖额外3D信息，要么仅通过浅层特征融合将几何编码器与RGB模型结合，效果有限。

Method: SpaceMind采用双编码器架构，结合VGGT作为空间理解编码器和InternViT作为2D视觉编码器，并提出轻量级的“相机引导模态融合”模块：在语言模型前对空间token施加相机条件偏置、赋予反映几何重要性的查询无关权重，并利用相机嵌入门控融合表示。

Result: SpaceMind在VSI-Bench、SQA3D和SPBench三个基准上均达到新的最先进水平，在VSI-Bench和SPBench上大幅超越现有开源和闭源系统，并在SQA3D上取得SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 将相机表示视为主动引导模态而非被动元数据，通过相机引导的模态融合可有效赋予视觉语言模型真正具备空间基础的智能，是一种实用且高效的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) show strong multimodal understanding but still struggle with 3D spatial reasoning, such as distance estimation, size comparison, and cross-view consistency. Existing 3D-aware methods either depend on auxiliary 3D information or enhance RGB-only VLMs with geometry encoders through shallow feature fusion. We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D. These results demonstrate that camera-guided modality fusion is an effective and practical inductive bias for equipping VLMs with genuinely spatially grounded intelligence. We will release code and model checkpoints to support future research.

Motivation: 当前AI生成图像逼真度高，难以与真实图像区分，对社会信任和信息完整性构成威胁；现有检测方法缺乏可验证的因果证据链，依赖表面模式匹配，导致泛化能力差、解释性不足。

Method: 构建首个基于证据链的多模态基准REVEAL-Bench，并提出REVEAL框架，结合轻量级专家模型与专家引导的强化学习，通过专门设计的奖励机制联合优化检测准确性、解释保真度和逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: REVEAL通过引入可验证的推理证据链，有效提升了AI生成图像检测的准确性与可解释性，为可信多媒体取证提供了新范式。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, visually realistic AI-generated images have become increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic ones, posing severe threats to social trust and information integrity. Consequently, there is an urgent need for efficient and truly explainable image forensic methods. Recent detection paradigms have shifted towards explainable forensics. However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications. Building upon this dataset, we propose \textbf{REVEAL} (\underline{R}easoning-\underline{e}nhanced Forensic E\underline{v}id\underline{e}nce \underline{A}na\underline{l}ysis), an effective and explainable forensic framework that integrates detection with a novel expert-grounded reinforcement learning. Our reward mechanism is specially tailored to jointly optimize detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence grounded in explicit forensic evidence, enabling REVEAL to produce fine-grained, interpretable, and verifiable reasoning chains alongside its detection outcomes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, benchmarking a new state of the art for explainable image forensics.

Conclusion: 将深度伪造分析从真实性验证转向意图理解，为更全面地应对生成式模型带来的社会风险提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to increasingly realistic deepfake videos, posing significant societal and security risks. While existing detection methods focus on distinguishing real from fake videos, such approaches fail to address a fundamental question: What is the intent behind a manipulated video? Towards addressing this question, we introduce IntentHQ: a new benchmark for human-centered intent analysis, shifting the paradigm from authenticity verification to contextual understanding of videos. IntentHQ consists of 5168 videos that have been meticulously collected and annotated with 23 fine-grained intent-categories, including "Financial fraud", "Indirect marketing", "Political propaganda", as well as "Fear mongering". We perform intent recognition with supervised and self-supervised multi-modality models that integrate spatio-temporal video features, audio processing, and text analysis to infer underlying motivations and goals behind videos. Our proposed model is streamlined to differentiate between a wide range of intent-categories.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到3D生成方法在推理阶段缺乏对生成质量的有效提升机制，且通常依赖大量训练。作者旨在探索无需额外训练的推理时优化策略，以提高3D扩散模型的生成效果。

Method: ITS3D将文本到3D生成视为一个优化问题，通过验证器引导的搜索算法迭代优化高斯噪声输入。具体包括：1）高斯归一化以稳定搜索过程；2）基于奇异值分解的压缩技术降低高维搜索空间的计算复杂度；3）奇异空间重置机制提升多样性，避免陷入局部最优。

Conclusion: ITS3D展示了在不增加训练成本的前提下，通过推理时优化有效提升3D生成质量的可行性，为未来3D生成模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: We explore inference-time scaling in text-guided 3D diffusion models to enhance generative quality without additional training. To this end, we introduce ITS3D, a framework that formulates the task as an optimization problem to identify the most effective Gaussian noise input. The framework is driven by a verifier-guided search algorithm, where the search algorithm iteratively refines noise candidates based on verifier feedback. To address the inherent challenges of 3D generation, we introduce three techniques for improved stability, efficiency, and exploration capability. 1) Gaussian normalization is applied to stabilize the search process. It corrects distribution shifts when noise candidates deviate from a standard Gaussian distribution during iterative updates. 2) The high-dimensional nature of the 3D search space increases computational complexity. To mitigate this, a singular value decomposition-based compression technique is employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving effective search directions. 3) To further prevent convergence to suboptimal local minima, a singular space reset mechanism dynamically updates the search space based on diversity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITS3D enhances text-to-3D generation quality, which shows the potential of computationally efficient search methods in generative processes.

*Silvia Zuffi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于学习的新方法，仅使用单张地面RGB图像即可估算地上生物量（AGB），通过生成AGB密度图并在合成与真实数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AGB估算方法依赖耗时的实地测量或在茂密植被中表现受限的遥感技术，亟需一种更高效、可扩展且成本低的替代方案。

Method: 将AGB估计建模为密集预测任务，利用合成3D SPREAD数据集中的树木属性和实例分割掩码，结合异速生长方程生成AGB标签，训练模型预测每像素的AGB密度图，并积分得到整幅图像的AGB估计值。

Result: 该方法在SPREAD测试集上的中位AGB误差为1.22 kg/m²，在真实图像数据集上为1.94 kg/m²，是首个从单张RGB图像直接估计AGB的方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法为森林监测提供了一种可扩展、可解释且经济高效的解决方案，并有望通过公民科学推动广泛应用。

Abstract: Forests play a critical role in global ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and mitigating climate change via carbon sequestration. Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于高斯的时空表示方法，仅使用三个相机视角即可实现对动态火焰的三维重建，通过融合多视角立体图像、单目深度先验和稠密光流，并结合定制硬件同步方案，在多种真实火焰场景中展现出鲁棒性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火焰具有高度挥发性、透明性和丰富的高频特征，使其捕捉与三维重建极具挑战；现有方法难以在有限视角（如仅三个视角）下有效重建其动态几何结构。

Conclusion: 所提方法能够在仅使用三个视角和低成本商用硬件的情况下，高效、鲁棒地重建复杂动态火焰的三维结构。

Abstract: We propose a method to reconstruct dynamic fire in 3D from a limited set of camera views with a Gaussian-based spatiotemporal representation. Capturing and reconstructing fire and its dynamics is highly challenging due to its volatile nature, transparent quality, and multitude of high-frequency features. Despite these challenges, we aim to reconstruct fire from only three views, which consequently requires solving for under-constrained geometry. We solve this by separating the static background from the dynamic fire region by combining dense multi-view stereo images with monocular depth priors. The fire is initialized as a 3D flow field, obtained by fusing per-view dense optical flow projections. To capture the high frequency features of fire, each 3D Gaussian encodes a lifetime and linear velocity to match the dense optical flow. To ensure sub-frame temporal alignment across cameras we employ a custom hardware synchronization pattern -- allowing us to reconstruct fire with affordable commodity hardware. Our quantitative and qualitative validations across numerous reconstruction experiments demonstrate robust performance for diverse and challenging real fire scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为USArt的深度学习方法，用于在加速MRI采集（最高达5倍）的同时，联合校正欠采样、噪声和运动伪影，显著提升2D脑部解剖图像的信噪比和对比度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRI加速方法通常只关注从欠采样数据中恢复图像质量，或单独处理伪影（如噪声或运动），缺乏同时应对加速与多种伪影校正的统一方案，限制了模型在真实临床场景中的性能。

Method: 提出USArt模型，采用双子模型架构，专门针对笛卡尔采样获取的2D脑部解剖图像，联合处理欠采样重建与噪声/运动伪影校正；实验评估了多种欠采样策略和退化程度。

Result: USArt在多种欠采样策略下均有效，其中梯度欠采样效果最佳，实现了高达5倍的加速，并在同时校正伪影的情况下显著提升了图像的信噪比和对比度，且无明显质量损失。

Conclusion: USArt是一种鲁棒性强的方法，能够有效应对真实MRI中同时存在的欠采样和多种伪影问题，在保证诊断质量的前提下大幅缩短扫描时间。

Abstract: MR data are acquired in the frequency domain, known as k-space. Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings.

Conclusion: RoadSceneBench为研究中层道路语义和推动结构感知的自动驾驶感知提供了紧凑而强大的基础。

Abstract: Understanding mid-level road semantics, which capture the structural and contextual cues that link low-level perception to high-level planning, is essential for reliable autonomous driving and digital map construction. However, existing benchmarks primarily target perception tasks such as detection or segmentation, overlooking the reasoning capabilities required to infer road topology and dynamic scene structure. To address this gap, we present RoadSceneBench, a lightweight yet information-rich benchmark designed to evaluate and advance visual reasoning in complex road environments. Unlike large-scale perception datasets, RoadSceneBench emphasizes relational understanding and structural consistency, encouraging models to capture the underlying logic of real-world road scenes. Furthermore, to enhance reasoning reliability, we propose Hierarchical Relational Reward Propagation with Temporal Consistency (HRRP-T), a training framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in which reward signals adaptively promote spatial coherence and semantic alignment throughout the reasoning process. This paradigm enables models to move beyond static recognition toward geometry-aware and temporally consistent reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse road configurations. RoadSceneBench thus provides a compact yet powerful foundation for studying mid-level road semantics and fostering structure-aware autonomous perception.

Result: 预训练LVLMs效果有限，而经过微调的LVLMs能够生成准确且具有安全意识的驾驶指令；但在检测视频中细微或复杂事件方面仍存在不足。

Conclusion: 微调可显著提升LVLMs在双视角驾驶安全任务中的表现，但需进一步改进以应对复杂场景；本研究为未来LVLM在智能驾驶中的应用提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit advanced capabilities in tasks that require visual information, including object detection. These capabilities have promising applications in various industrial domains, such as autonomous driving. For example, LVLMs can generate safety-oriented descriptions of videos captured by road-facing cameras. However, ensuring comprehensive safety requires monitoring driver-facing views as well to detect risky events, such as the use of mobiles while driving. Thus, the ability to process synchronized inputs is necessary from both driver-facing and road-facing cameras. In this study, we develop models and investigate the capabilities of LVLMs by constructing a dataset and evaluating their performance on this dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that while pre-trained LVLMs have limited effectiveness, fine-tuned LVLMs can generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions. Nonetheless, several challenges remain, particularly in detecting subtle or complex events in the video. Our findings and error analysis provide valuable insights that can contribute to the improvement of LVLM-based systems in this domain.

Abstract: Text-based person anomaly retrieval has emerged as a challenging task, with most existing approaches relying on complex deep-learning techniques. This raises a research question: How can the model be optimized to achieve greater fine-grained features? To address this, we propose a Local-Global Hybrid Perspective (LHP) module integrated with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), designed to explore the effectiveness of incorporating both fine-grained features alongside coarse-grained features. Additionally, we investigate a Unified Image-Text (UIT) model that combines multiple objective loss functions, including Image-Text Contrastive (ITC), Image-Text Matching (ITM), Masked Language Modeling (MLM), and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) loss. Beyond this, we propose a novel iterative ensemble strategy, by combining iteratively instead of using model results simultaneously like other ensemble methods. To take advantage of the superior performance of the LHP model, we introduce a novel feature selection algorithm based on its guidance, which helps improve the model's performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on PAB dataset, compared with previous work, with a 9.70\% improvement in R@1, 1.77\% improvement in R@5, and 1.01\% improvement in R@10.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Rectified MeanFlow（Re-MeanFlow），通过在仅一次reflow步骤中建模沿rectified轨迹的平均速度场，实现高效的一次采样生成，并引入截断启发式方法进一步提升性能，在ImageNet多个分辨率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于流的生成模型在采样时通常依赖昂贵的ODE数值积分；Rectified Flow虽支持一步采样，但需多次reflow迭代以获得近似直线路径；MeanFlow虽直接建模平均速度，但在高度弯曲流上训练缓慢且监督噪声大。因此，亟需一种兼顾效率与性能的一步生成方法。

Method: 提出Rectified MeanFlow框架，仅使用单次reflow步骤建模rectified轨迹上的平均速度场，并引入一种简单的截断启发式策略以减少残余曲率，从而提升生成质量和训练效率。

Result: 在ImageNet 64×64、256×256和512×512分辨率上的大量实验表明，Re-MeanFlow在样本质量和训练效率方面均优于先前的一次流蒸馏方法和Rectified Flow方法。

Conclusion: Rectified MeanFlow有效结合了Rectified Flow与MeanFlow的优点，在仅需一次reflow的前提下实现了高质量、高效率的一次生成，显著提升了流模型的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong performance, yet sampling typically relies on expensive numerical integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Rectified Flow enables one-step sampling by learning nearly straight probability paths, but achieving such straightness requires multiple computationally intensive reflow iterations. MeanFlow achieves one-step generation by directly modeling the average velocity over time; however, when trained on highly curved flows, it suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision. To address these limitations, we propose Rectified MeanFlow, a framework that models the mean velocity field along the rectified trajectory using only a single reflow step. This eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while enabling efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective truncation heuristic that aims to reduce residual curvature and further improve performance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show that Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/Xinxi-Zhang/Re-MeanFlow.

Conclusion: 冻结的视觉基础模型（如DINOv3）天然具备跨生成器伪造检测能力，其依赖低频全局结构作为可迁移线索；所提方法提供了一个高效、通用且可解释的图像伪造检测基线。

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly diverse and powerful, cross-generator detection has emerged as a new challenge. Existing detection methods often memorize artifacts of specific generative models rather than learning transferable cues, leading to substantial failures on unseen generators. Surprisingly, this work finds that frozen visual foundation models, especially DINOv3, already exhibit strong cross-generator detection capability without any fine-tuning. Through systematic studies on frequency, spatial, and token perspectives, we observe that DINOv3 tends to rely on global, low-frequency structures as weak but transferable authenticity cues instead of high-frequency, generator-specific artifacts. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free token-ranking strategy followed by a lightweight linear probe to select a small subset of authenticity-relevant tokens. This token subset consistently improves detection accuracy across all evaluated datasets. Our study provides empirical evidence and a feasible hypothesis for understanding why foundation models generalize across diverse generators, offering a universal, efficient, and interpretable baseline for image forgery detection.

Abstract: We propose Dimitra++, a novel framework for audio-driven talking head generation, streamlined to learn lip motion, facial expression, as well as head pose motion. Specifically, we propose a conditional Motion Diffusion Transformer (cMDT) to model facial motion sequences, employing a 3D representation. The cMDT is conditioned on two inputs: a reference facial image, which determines appearance, as well as an audio sequence, which drives the motion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments, as well as a user study on two widely employed datasets, i.e., VoxCeleb2 and CelebV-HQ, suggest that Dimitra++ is able to outperform existing approaches in generating realistic talking heads imparting lip motion, facial expression, and head pose.

Abstract: As the number of scientific papers continues to grow, there is a demand for approaches that can effectively convey research findings, with posters serving as a key medium for presenting paper contents. Poster layouts determine how effectively research is communicated and understood, highlighting their growing importance. In particular, a gap remains in understanding how papers correspond to the layouts that present them, which calls for datasets with paired annotations at scale. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciPostGen, a large-scale dataset for understanding and generating poster layouts from scientific papers. Our analyses based on SciPostGen show that paper structures are associated with the number of layout elements in posters. Based on this insight, we explore a framework, Retrieval-Augmented Poster Layout Generation, which retrieves layouts consistent with a given paper and uses them as guidance for layout generation. We conducted experiments under two conditions: with and without layout constraints typically specified by poster creators. The results show that the retriever estimates layouts aligned with paper structures, and our framework generates layouts that also satisfy given constraints.

Conclusion: 该研究为实际文本去除任务中的人工掩码操作提供了用户友好的指导原则，并强调了精细调整掩码形状的重要性。

Abstract: The advent of generative models has dramatically improved the accuracy of image inpainting. In particular, by removing specific text from document images, reconstructing original images is extremely important for industrial applications. However, most existing methods of text removal focus on deleting simple scene text which appears in images captured by a camera in an outdoor environment. There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks. It was also found that the minimum cover of a text region is not optimal. Our research is expected to pave the way for a user-friendly guideline for manual masking.

Conclusion: Fast3Dcache在几乎不影响几何质量的前提下显著加速了3D扩散模型的推理过程，为高效3D生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive generative quality across modalities like 2D images, videos, and 3D shapes, but their inference remains computationally expensive due to the iterative denoising process. While recent caching-based methods effectively reuse redundant computations to speed up 2D and video generation, directly applying these techniques to 3D diffusion models can severely disrupt geometric consistency. In 3D synthesis, even minor numerical errors in cached latent features accumulate, causing structural artifacts and topological inconsistencies. To overcome this limitation, we propose Fast3Dcache, a training-free geometry-aware caching framework that accelerates 3D diffusion inference while preserving geometric fidelity. Our method introduces a Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically determine cache quotas according to voxel stabilization patterns and a Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features for reuse based on velocity magnitude and acceleration criterion. Comprehensive experiments show that Fast3Dcache accelerates inference significantly, achieving up to a 27.12% speed-up and a 54.8% reduction in FLOPs, with minimal degradation in geometric quality as measured by Chamfer Distance (2.48%) and F-Score (1.95%).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Diff-ICMH，一种兼顾人类感知与机器智能任务的生成式图像压缩框架，通过语义一致性损失和标签引导模块，在单一码流中同时实现高质量视觉体验与多任务语义保真。


<details>

Motivation: 传统图像压缩方法通常分别优化人类感知或机器分析任务，忽略了二者在保留语义信息和提升感知质量方面的共通性。作者旨在构建一个统一框架，同时满足人类视觉偏好与机器智能任务对语义完整性的需求。

Method: 提出Diff-ICMH框架：利用生成先验确保感知真实性；引入语义一致性损失（SC loss）保障语义保真度；设计标签引导模块（TGM），利用图像级语义标签激发预训练扩散模型的生成能力，仅需极少额外码率。

Conclusion: 通过融合人类与机器视觉需求，Diff-ICMH实现了语义保真与感知质量的协同优化，为通用图像压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Image compression methods are usually optimized isolatedly for human perception or machine analysis tasks. We reveal fundamental commonalities between these objectives: preserving accurate semantic information is paramount, as it directly dictates the integrity of critical information for intelligent tasks and aids human understanding. Concurrently, enhanced perceptual quality not only improves visual appeal but also, by ensuring realistic image distributions, benefits semantic feature extraction for machine tasks. Based on this insight, we propose Diff-ICMH, a generative image compression framework aiming for harmonizing machine and human vision in image compression. It ensures perceptual realism by leveraging generative priors and simultaneously guarantees semantic fidelity through the incorporation of Semantic Consistency loss (SC loss) during training. Additionally, we introduce the Tag Guidance Module (TGM) that leverages highly semantic image-level tags to stimulate the pre-trained diffusion model's generative capabilities, requiring minimal additional bit rates. Consequently, Diff-ICMH supports multiple intelligent tasks through a single codec and bitstream without any task-specific adaptation, while preserving high-quality visual experience for human perception. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Diff-ICMH's superiority and generalizability across diverse tasks, while maintaining visual appeal for human perception.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种文本条件嵌入的基台设计框架（TCEAD），通过引入文本引导定位模块（TGL）并结合自监督学习方法，显著提升了牙科种植基台自动设计的精度与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统牙科种植基台设计过程耗时费力，且长期使用不合适的基台可能导致种植体周围炎等并发症；因此，亟需借助人工智能技术提高设计效率与适配性。

Method: 在MeshMAE自监督学习框架基础上，引入基于CLIP文本编码器的文本引导定位（TGL）模块，利用口扫数据预训练编码器以增强局部细粒度特征提取能力，从而实现对基台区域的精准定位与参数生成。

Result: 在大规模基台设计数据集上的实验表明，TCEAD相较主流方法在交并比（IoU）指标上提升0.8%–12.85%。

Conclusion: 所提出的TCEAD框架在自动化牙科基台设计中展现出显著优势和应用潜力。

Abstract: The abutment is an important part of artificial dental implants, whose design process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Long-term use of inappropriate dental implant abutments may result in implant complications, including peri-implantitis. Using artificial intelligence to assist dental implant abutment design can quickly improve the efficiency of abutment design and enhance abutment adaptability. In this paper, we propose a text condition embedded abutment design framework (TCEAD), the novel automated abutment design solution available in literature. The proposed study extends the self-supervised learning framework of the mesh mask autoencoder (MeshMAE) by introducing a text-guided localization (TGL) module to facilitate abutment area localization. As the parameter determination of the abutment is heavily dependent on local fine-grained features (the width and height of the implant and the distance to the opposing tooth), we pre-train the encoder using oral scan data to improve the model's feature extraction ability. Moreover, considering that the abutment area is only a small part of the oral scan data, we designed a TGL module, which introduces the description of the abutment area through the text encoder of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), enabling the network to quickly locate the abutment area. We validated the performance of TCEAD on a large abutment design dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCEAD achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) improvement of 0.8%-12.85% over other mainstream methods, underscoring its potential in automated dental abutment design.

TL;DR: 本文提出AnoRefiner，一种可插拔的细化模块，利用异常得分图增强零样本工业异常检测（ZSAD）模型生成的粗粒度异常图，实现像素级精化，并通过组内渐进式测试时训练策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ZSAD方法仅提取图像块级特征，导致异常图粗糙；后续细化方法因合成异常与真实异常存在差距，难以恢复细粒度异常且易漏检。作者发现异常得分图能提供ZSAD图像特征中缺失的空间线索。

Method: 提出AnoRefiner，包含两个核心组件：1）异常细化解码器（ARD），利用异常得分图逐步增强图像特征，减少对合成异常数据的依赖；2）渐进式分组测试时训练策略（PGT），在产品组内训练ARD用于下一组的细化，兼容任意ZSAD方法。

Result: 在MVTec AD和VisA数据集上，AnoRefiner使多种ZSAD模型的像素级平均精度（pixel-AP）最高提升5.2%，可视化结果也明显改善。

Conclusion: AnoRefiner有效提升了ZSAD模型的细粒度异常检测能力，具有通用性和实用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Zero-shot industrial anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods typically yield coarse anomaly maps as vision transformers (ViTs) extract patch-level features only. To solve this, recent solutions attempt to predict finer anomalies using features from ZSAD, but they still struggle to recover fine-grained anomalies without missed detections, mainly due to the gap between randomly synthesized training anomalies and real ones. We observe that anomaly score maps exactly provide complementary spatial cues that are largely absent from ZSAD's image features, a fact overlooked before.
  Inspired by this, we propose an anomaly-aware refiner (AnoRefiner) that can be plugged into most ZSAD models and improve patch-level anomaly maps to the pixel level. First, we design an anomaly refinement decoder (ARD) that progressively enhances image features using anomaly score maps, reducing the reliance on synthetic anomaly data. Second, motivated by the mass production paradigm, we propose a progressive group-wise test-time training (PGT) strategy that trains ARD in each product group for the refinement process in the next group, while staying compatible with any ZSAD method.
  Experiments on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets show that AnoRefiner boosts various ZSAD models by up to a 5.2\% gain in pixel-AP metrics, which can also be directly observed in many visualizations. The code will be available at https://github.com/HUST-SLOW/AnoRefiner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型通常将MLLM编码器冻结训练，未能充分利用其推理能力；作者旨在通过解锁MLLM的推理能力（如思考与反思机制）来提升指令理解和编辑准确性。

Method: 提出ReasonEdit框架，引入“思考-编辑-反思”循环：思考机制利用MLLM的世界知识解析抽象指令，反思机制自动校正编辑结果并判断停止时机。

Result: 在ImgEdit、GEdit和Kris数据集上分别实现+4.3%、+4.7%和+8.2%的性能提升；基于Step1X-Edit和Qwen-Image-Edit的两个版本均优于先前开源方法。

Conclusion: 解锁MLLM的推理能力可显著提升图像编辑模型性能，所提ReasonEdit框架有效增强了对复杂指令的理解与编辑结果的准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing models have shown remarkable progress. A common architectural design couples a multimodal large language model (MLLM) encoder with a diffusion decoder, as seen in systems such as Step1X-Edit and Qwen-Image-Edit, where the MLLM encodes both the reference image and the instruction but remains frozen during training. In this work, we demonstrate that unlocking the reasoning capabilities of MLLM can further push the boundaries of editing models. Specifically, we explore two reasoning mechanisms, thinking and reflection, which enhance instruction understanding and editing accuracy. Based on that, our proposed framework enables image editing in a thinking-editing-reflection loop: the thinking mechanism leverages the world knowledge of MLLM to interpret abstract instructions, while the reflection reviews editing results, automatically corrects unintended manipulations, and identifies the stopping round. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reasoning approach achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of ImgEdit (+4.3%), GEdit (+4.7%), and Kris (+8.2%) when initializing our DiT from the Step1X-Edit (ReasonEdit-S), and also outperforms previous open-source methods on both GEdit and Kris when integrated with Qwen-Image-Edit (ReasonEdit-Q).

Conclusion: GeoZero有效解决了依赖人工CoT标注的问题，在不使用预定义思维链监督的情况下显著提升了MLLMs的地理空间推理能力，具有良好的泛化性和实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have undergone rapid development in advancing geospatial scene understanding. Recent studies have sought to enhance the reasoning capabilities of remote sensing MLLMs, typically through cold-start training with elaborately curated chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, this approach not only incurs substantial annotation costs but also introduces human biases that may limit the diversity of model reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose GeoZero, a framework that enables MLLMs to perform geospatial reasoning without any predefined CoT supervision. Specifically, we construct two datasets, GeoZero-Instruct and GeoZero-Hard. GeoZero-Instruct allows the model to acquire preliminary geospatial knowledge through supervised fine-tuning, while GeoZero-Hard stimulates deep reasoning during the subsequent reinforcement learning stage. Furthermore, we introduce Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A$^2$GRPO), where the reasoning process is regularized by the model's own answers, encouraging diverse yet accurate thinking. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that GeoZero not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods but also fosters universal emergent reasoning capabilities across diverse geospatial tasks. Code,data,and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/GeoZero.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为注意力交互对齐（AIA）损失的新方法，在不进行模型解耦的前提下缓解多模态统一模型中理解与生成任务之间的冲突，从而同时提升生成和理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一的多模态模型在图像生成与理解任务中面临目标冲突的问题，现有方法常通过模型解耦缓解冲突，但过度解耦会损害交错生成能力。因此，作者希望在不依赖模型解耦的情况下解决任务冲突。

Method: 通过分析跨模态注意力行为，发现模型解耦实质上促使模型形成任务特定的多模态交互模式。基于此，作者提出AIA损失函数，在训练中显式学习这些任务特定的交互模式，并将其应用于Emu3和Janus-Pro模型的SFT及后训练阶段。

Result: AIA损失在无需额外技巧的情况下，不仅优化了跨模态注意力模式，还同时提升了模型的生成与理解性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的AIA损失是一种有效且通用的方法，能够在保持模型统一性的同时缓解任务冲突，为构建高性能统一多模态模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models for image generation and understanding represent a significant step toward AGI and have attracted widespread attention from researchers. The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本设置下表现良好，但在监督数据有限的下游任务中适应能力受限；当前多模态提示学习方法通常使用固定共享提示和确定性参数，难以捕捉实例级差异或建模跨任务与领域的不确定性。

Method: 提出变分多模态提示学习（VaMP）框架，通过从学习到的后验分布中采样生成实例条件提示，并引入基于实例表示和类别原型的类别感知先验，将提示调优形式化为对潜在提示表示的变分推断，并通过重参数化采样进行端到端训练。

Result: 在少样本学习和领域泛化基准上的实验表明，VaMP达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VaMP通过建模不确定性和任务结构，显著提升了多模态提示学习在下游任务中的适应能力，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown strong generalization under zero-shot settings, yet adapting them to downstream tasks with limited supervision remains a significant challenge. Existing multi-modal prompt learning methods typically rely on fixed, shared prompts and deterministic parameters, which limits their ability to capture instance-level variation or model uncertainty across diverse tasks and domains. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning (VaMP) framework that enables sample-specific, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning in multi-modal representation learning. VaMP generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from a learned posterior distribution, allowing the model to personalize its behavior based on input content. To further enhance the integration of local and global semantics, we introduce a class-aware prior derived from the instance representation and class prototype. Building upon these, we formulate prompt tuning as variational inference over latent prompt representations and train the entire framework end-to-end through reparameterized sampling. Experiments on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks show that VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the benefits of modeling both uncertainty and task structure in our method.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了分布匹配蒸馏（DMD）在扩散模型蒸馏中的作用，指出其在文本到图像等复杂任务中，真正驱动少步蒸馏效果的核心并非分布匹配（DM），而是一个被忽视的成分——CFG增强（CA）。DM主要起正则化作用以稳定训练并减少伪影。作者进一步表明，其他非参数约束或GAN目标也可替代DM实现类似稳定效果，并基于此提出解耦噪声调度等改进策略，显著提升性能，相关方法已被Z-Image项目采用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究普遍认为DMD及其变体的优异性能源于学生模型与教师模型输出分布的匹配，但作者质疑这一观点，旨在深入剖析DMD训练目标的真实驱动力，特别是在需要分类器引导（CFG）的复杂生成任务中。

Method: 通过严格分解DMD训练目标，识别出CFG增强（CA）和分布匹配（DM）两个关键组成部分；分析二者在蒸馏过程中的不同角色（CA为“引擎”，DM为“正则器”）；验证DM可被其他正则化手段替代；并据此提出解耦噪声调度等新蒸馏策略。

Result: 实验表明，在文本到图像等任务中，CFG增强是少步蒸馏性能的主要来源，而分布匹配主要提供训练稳定性；用其他正则项替代DM仍可获得良好效果；所提改进方法有效提升了模型性能，并被实际项目采纳。

Conclusion: DMD中分布匹配并非蒸馏效果的核心驱动力，真正关键的是CFG增强；将蒸馏过程解耦为“引擎”与“正则器”有助于更系统地理解和改进蒸馏方法，所提策略具有良好的泛化性和实用性。

Abstract: Diffusion model distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for creating efficient few-step and single-step generators. Among these, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) and its variants stand out for their impressive performance, which is widely attributed to their core mechanism of matching the student's output distribution to that of a pre-trained teacher model. In this work, we challenge this conventional understanding. Through a rigorous decomposition of the DMD training objective, we reveal that in complex tasks like text-to-image generation, where CFG is typically required for desirable few-step performance, the primary driver of few-step distillation is not distribution matching, but a previously overlooked component we identify as CFG Augmentation (CA). We demonstrate that this term acts as the core ``engine'' of distillation, while the Distribution Matching (DM) term functions as a ``regularizer'' that ensures training stability and mitigates artifacts. We further validate this decoupling by demonstrating that while the DM term is a highly effective regularizer, it is not unique; simpler non-parametric constraints or GAN-based objectives can serve the same stabilizing function, albeit with different trade-offs. This decoupling of labor motivates a more principled analysis of the properties of both terms, leading to a more systematic and in-depth understanding. This new understanding further enables us to propose principled modifications to the distillation process, such as decoupling the noise schedules for the engine and the regularizer, leading to further performance gains. Notably, our method has been adopted by the Z-Image ( https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image ) project to develop a top-tier 8-step image generation model, empirically validating the generalization and robustness of our findings.

TL;DR: Ar2Can is a two-stage framework for generating multi-human scenes that separates spatial layout planning from identity-aware image rendering, significantly improving count accuracy and identity preservation using mostly synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle with generating reliable multi-human scenes, often duplicating faces, merging identities, or miscounting individuals.

Method: Ar2Can uses a two-stage approach: (1) an Architect module predicts structured person layouts; (2) an Artist module generates photorealistic images guided by a spatially-grounded face matching reward combining Hungarian alignment and ArcFace similarity. The system is trained via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with compositional rewards.

Result: On the MultiHuman-Testbench, Ar2Can achieves significant improvements in count accuracy and identity preservation while maintaining high perceptual quality, using primarily synthetic training data.

Conclusion: Ar2Can effectively addresses key challenges in multi-human image generation by disentangling layout and identity rendering, achieving strong performance without reliance on real multi-human images.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image generation, existing models consistently fail to produce reliable multi-human scenes, often duplicating faces, merging identities, or miscounting individuals. We present Ar2Can, a novel two-stage framework that disentangles spatial planning from identity rendering for multi-human generation. The Architect module predicts structured layouts, specifying where each person should appear. The Artist module then synthesizes photorealistic images, guided by a spatially-grounded face matching reward that combines Hungarian spatial alignment with ArcFace identity similarity. This approach ensures faces are rendered at correct locations and faithfully preserve reference identities. We develop two Architect variants, seamlessly integrated with our diffusion-based Artist model and optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using compositional rewards for count accuracy, image quality, and identity matching. Evaluated on the MultiHuman-Testbench, Ar2Can achieves substantial improvements in both count accuracy and identity preservation, while maintaining high perceptual quality. Notably, our method achieves these results using primarily synthetic data, without requiring real multi-human images.

Motivation: 当前高性能图像生成模型主要由专有系统主导，而领先的开源替代方案参数量过大（20B-80B），难以在消费级硬件上进行推理和微调。为填补这一空白，作者旨在开发一个高效、低成本且性能卓越的开源模型。

Abstract: The landscape of high-performance image generation models is currently dominated by proprietary systems, such as Nano Banana Pro and Seedream 4.0. Leading open-source alternatives, including Qwen-Image, Hunyuan-Image-3.0 and FLUX.2, are characterized by massive parameter counts (20B to 80B), making them impractical for inference, and fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. To address this gap, we propose Z-Image, an efficient 6B-parameter foundation generative model built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture that challenges the "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. By systematically optimizing the entire model lifecycle -- from a curated data infrastructure to a streamlined training curriculum -- we complete the full training workflow in just 314K H800 GPU hours (approx. $630K). Our few-step distillation scheme with reward post-training further yields Z-Image-Turbo, offering both sub-second inference latency on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Additionally, our omni-pre-training paradigm also enables efficient training of Z-Image-Edit, an editing model with impressive instruction-following capabilities. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to or surpassing that of leading competitors across various dimensions. Most notably, Z-Image exhibits exceptional capabilities in photorealistic image generation and bilingual text rendering, delivering results that rival top-tier commercial models, thereby demonstrating that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. We publicly release our code, weights, and online demo to foster the development of accessible, budget-friendly, yet state-of-the-art generative models.

Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法通常依赖密集视角的逐场景优化，而基于多视角立体几何先验的前馈方法仍需大量重叠视角；本文旨在解决在大稀疏性（即视角重叠少）条件下实现稳定且高质量的新视角合成问题。

Method: 提出两阶段学习策略：第一阶段通过迭代亲和学习将尺度感知点图转换到真实空间，实现自监督训练；第二阶段将双目输入的点图投影到目标视图平面，通过立体匹配优化几何，并在此平面上锚定高斯基元进行渲染。

Conclusion: Splat-SAP 能有效应对稀疏双目输入下的新视角渲染挑战，无需3D监督即可实现高质量、稳定的自由视角合成。

Abstract: We present Splat-SAP, a feed-forward approach to render novel views of human-centered scenes from binocular cameras with large sparsity. Gaussian Splatting has shown its promising potential in rendering tasks, but it typically necessitates per-scene optimization with dense input views. Although some recent approaches achieve feed-forward Gaussian Splatting rendering through geometry priors obtained by multi-view stereo, such approaches still require largely overlapped input views to establish the geometry prior. To bridge this gap, we leverage pixel-wise point map reconstruction to represent geometry which is robust to large sparsity for its independent view modeling. In general, we propose a two-stage learning strategy. In stage 1, we transform the point map into real space via an iterative affinity learning process, which facilitates camera control in the following. In stage 2, we project point maps of two input views onto the target view plane and refine such geometry via stereo matching. Furthermore, we anchor Gaussian primitives on this refined plane in order to render high-quality images. As a metric representation, the scale-aware point map in stage 1 is trained in a self-supervised manner without 3D supervision and stage 2 is supervised with photo-metric loss. We collect multi-view human-centered data and demonstrate that our method improves both the stability of point map reconstruction and the visual quality of free-viewpoint rendering.

Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法效率有限，而结合遥感、航拍影像与深度学习技术有望改进现有方法；同时，VIS与TIR影像的互补性可能提升自动检测效果，但其对齐与融合面临视场角和分辨率差异等挑战。

Method: 研究采用YOLO11n模型，对同步获取的大蓝鹭VIS与TIR航拍图像进行自动对齐，并分别测试早融合（主成分分析融合图像对）和晚融合（基于分类回归树整合VIS-only与TIR-only模型检测结果）两种策略，评估其相对于仅使用VIS图像的性能提升。

Result: 两种融合方法均提升了所有类别的F1分数；对于主要类别“已占用巢穴”，晚融合将F1分数从90.2%（仅VIS）提升至93.0%，并能以90%的召回率识别双源假阳性。然而，TIR视场限制及对齐约束导致部分数据被剔除。

Conclusion: VIS-TIR图像融合可有效提升大蓝鹭自动检测性能，尤其是晚融合策略；但在实际应用中需权衡TIR视场限制与数据损失问题，高分辨率机载可见光传感器可能是更具操作性的替代方案。

Abstract: Efficient wildlife monitoring methods are necessary for biodiversity conservation and management. The combination of remote sensing, aerial imagery and deep learning offer promising opportunities to renew or improve existing survey methods. The complementary use of visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery can add information compared to a single-source image and improve results in an automated detection context. However, the alignment and fusion process can be challenging, especially since visible and thermal images usually have different fields of view (FOV) and spatial resolutions. This research presents a case study on the great blue heron (Ardea herodias) to evaluate the performances of synchronous aerial VIS and TIR imagery to automatically detect individuals and nests using a YOLO11n model. Two VIS-TIR fusion methods were tested and compared: an early fusion approach and a late fusion approach, to determine if the addition of the TIR image gives any added value compared to a VIS-only model. VIS and TIR images were automatically aligned using a deep learning model. A principal component analysis fusion method was applied to VIS-TIR image pairs to form the early fusion dataset. A classification and regression tree was used to process the late fusion dataset, based on the detection from the VIS-only and TIR-only trained models. Across all classes, both late and early fusion improved the F1 score compared to the VIS-only model. For the main class, occupied nest, the late fusion improved the F1 score from 90.2 (VIS-only) to 93.0%. This model was also able to identify false positives from both sources with 90% recall. Although fusion methods seem to give better results, this approach comes with a limiting TIR FOV and alignment constraints that eliminate data. Using an aircraft-mounted very high-resolution visible sensor could be an interesting option for operationalizing surveys.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在面对文化混合场景（如多种文化元素共存于同一图像中）时的表现，发现现有模型难以保持各文化元素的独立身份识别，并对背景过度依赖。为此，作者构建了一个名为CultureMix的食品视觉问答基准数据集，并通过实验验证了监督微调能有效提升模型在文化混合场景下的鲁棒性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在全球化背景下，不同文化的视觉元素常共存于同一场景中（即“文化混合”），但当前大型视觉语言模型对此类场景的理解能力尚不明确，亟需系统评估与改进。

Method: 构建包含23,000张人工验证、扩散模型生成图像的CultureMix VQA基准，涵盖四种子任务；评估10个LVLM在文化混合场景中的表现，并尝试三种鲁棒性增强策略，重点测试监督微调的效果。

Result: LVLM在文化混合场景中普遍存在文化身份识别失败问题：加入文化背景后准确率下降14%，且对相同食物在不同上下文中预测不一致；监督微调显著提升了模型的一致性并降低了对背景的敏感度。

Conclusion: 文化混合是LVLM面临的重要挑战，需更多关注此类场景以推动模型在多元文化真实环境中的可靠应用；使用多样化文化混合数据进行微调是提升模型鲁棒性的有效途径。

Abstract: In a globalized world, cultural elements from diverse origins frequently appear together within a single visual scene. We refer to these as culture mixing scenarios, yet how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) perceive them remains underexplored. We investigate culture mixing as a critical challenge for LVLMs and examine how current models behave when cultural items from multiple regions appear together. To systematically analyze these behaviors, we construct CultureMix, a food Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark with 23k diffusion-generated, human-verified culture mixing images across four subtasks: (1) food-only, (2) food+food, (3) food+background, and (4) food+food+background. Evaluating 10 LVLMs, we find consistent failures to preserve individual cultural identities in mixed settings. Models show strong background reliance, with accuracy dropping 14% when cultural backgrounds are added to food-only baselines, and they produce inconsistent predictions for identical foods across different contexts. To address these limitations, we explore three robustness strategies. We find supervised fine-tuning using a diverse culture mixing dataset substantially improve model consistency and reduce background sensitivity. We call for increased attention to culture mixing scenarios as a critical step toward developing LVLMs capable of operating reliably in culturally diverse real-world environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了CogIP-Bench基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对图像认知属性（如记忆性、趣味性、美感等）的理解能力，发现当前模型与人类感知存在显著差距，并通过后训练有效提升其与人类判断的一致性，且该能力可迁移至图像生成等下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs虽能识别图像内容，但难以理解图像对人类观察者产生的主观认知感受（如是否令人难忘、有趣或具有美感），缺乏对这类主观认知属性的建模能力。

Method: 构建CogIP-Bench评测基准，系统评估MLLM在图像认知属性上的表现；通过后训练阶段优化模型，提升其与人类感知的一致性；并将对齐后的模型集成到图像生成流程中，引导生成更具特定认知特质的图像。

Result: 实验表明当前MLLM在图像认知属性上与人类判断存在显著差距；后训练能有效提升模型对齐度；且该对齐能力可成功迁移到图像生成等创造性任务中，生成更符合人类偏好的图像。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一个衡量MLLM人类感知对齐度的基准、一种有效的后训练方法，并验证了认知对齐能力在提升AI人本化方面的潜力。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are adept at answering what is in an image-identifying objects and describing scenes-they often lack the ability to understand how an image feels to a human observer. This gap is most evident when considering subjective cognitive properties, such as what makes an image memorable, funny, aesthetically pleasing, or emotionally evocative. To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks. By integrating our cognitively-aligned MLLM into an image generation pipeline, we can guide the synthesis process to produce images that better embody desired traits, such as being more memorable or visually appealing. Our work provides a benchmark to measure this human-like perception, a post-training pipeline to enhance it, and a demonstration that this alignment unlocks more human-centric AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Captain Safari，一种基于位姿条件的世界引擎，通过从持久世界记忆中检索信息来生成长时、3D一致且支持交互式相机路径控制的视频，并发布了新数据集OpenSafari用于评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界引擎在处理激进的6自由度相机轨迹和复杂户外场景时，难以维持长期几何一致性、容易偏离目标路径或产生过于保守的运动。

Method: Captain Safari采用动态局部记忆机制，结合检索器获取与相机位姿对齐的世界token，以此作为条件生成沿指定轨迹的视频；同时构建了包含高动态无人机视频和验证相机轨迹的新数据集OpenSafari。

Result: 在视频质量、3D一致性和轨迹跟随方面，Captain Safari显著优于现有方法：MEt3R从0.3703降至0.3690，AUC@30从0.181提升至0.200，FVD显著降低；在50人参与的人类偏好研究中，67.6%的选择支持该方法。

Conclusion: 位姿条件下的世界记忆机制是实现长时程、可控视频生成的有效途径，OpenSafari为未来世界引擎研究提供了具有挑战性的新基准。

Abstract: World engines aim to synthesize long, 3D-consistent videos that support interactive exploration of a scene under user-controlled camera motion. However, existing systems struggle under aggressive 6-DoF trajectories and complex outdoor layouts: they lose long-range geometric coherence, deviate from the target path, or collapse into overly conservative motion. To this end, we introduce Captain Safari, a pose-conditioned world engine that generates videos by retrieving from a persistent world memory. Given a camera path, our method maintains a dynamic local memory and uses a retriever to fetch pose-aligned world tokens, which then condition video generation along the trajectory. This design enables the model to maintain stable 3D structure while accurately executing challenging camera maneuvers. To evaluate this setting, we curate OpenSafari, a new in-the-wild FPV dataset containing high-dynamic drone videos with verified camera trajectories, constructed through a multi-stage geometric and kinematic validation pipeline. Across video quality, 3D consistency, and trajectory following, Captain Safari substantially outperforms state-of-the-art camera-controlled generators. It reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, and yields substantially lower FVD than all camera-controlled baselines. More importantly, in a 50-participant, 5-way human study where annotators select the best result among five anonymized models, 67.6% of preferences favor our method across all axes. Our results demonstrate that pose-conditioned world memory is a powerful mechanism for long-horizon, controllable video generation and provide OpenSafari as a challenging new benchmark for future world-engine research.

TL;DR: 本文提出MMA-Bench评测基准，揭示当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在面对模态冲突时的脆弱性，并提出一种模态对齐微调策略以提升其跨模态推理的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在处理相互矛盾的模态信息时是否具备鲁棒性尚不明确，亟需系统性评估与改进方法。

Method: 构建包含音视频冲突和误导文本的MMA-Bench评测集，结合黑盒与白盒可解释性技术分析模型行为，并提出模态对齐微调策略，指导模型在不同情境下合理利用或忽略特定模态线索。

Result: 实验表明现有MLLMs在模态不一致情况下表现不佳，而所提出的对齐微调方法显著增强了模型的多模态接地能力。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了评估MLLM模态鲁棒性的工具和数据集，还为构建具备可靠跨模态推理能力的模型指明了方向。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a fundamental question remains: are MLLMs robust to contradicting modalities? To rigorously study this, we introduce MMA-Bench comprising videos and tasks that probe a model's reliance on specific modalities. Using black-box and white-box interpretability techniques, we provide a critical analysis of the brittleness of both open- and closed-sourced MLLMs. We show that current MLLMs struggle under misaligned audio-visual pairs and simple misleading text, thereby lacking robust multi-modal reasoning. Building on these findings, we propose a modality alignment tuning strategy to teach the model when to prioritize, leverage, or ignore specific modality cues. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that our alignment tuning yields demonstrably stronger multimodal grounding. This work provides both interpretability tools and a clear path toward developing MLLMs with intrinsically reliable cross-modal reasoning. Code and dataset will be publicly available.

*Dosung Lee,Sangwon Jung,Boyoung Kim,Minyoung Kim,Sungyeon Kim,Junyoung Sung,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文指出当前多模态知识视觉问答（MKB-VQA）基准存在“视觉捷径”问题，即图像通常与文档主实体匹配，导致模型仅依赖视觉线索即可取得较好效果。为此，作者提出新基准RETINA，通过LLM自动生成，包含12万训练样本和2千人工筛选测试样本，其查询针对次级相关实体并配以对应图像，从而消除视觉捷径。实验表明现有模型在RETINA上性能显著下降，验证了其对捷径的依赖。作者还提出多图像多模态检索器MIMIR，通过引入多个相关实体图像增强文档表征，在RETINA上表现优于仅使用单图的现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MKB-VQA基准因图像与主实体高度匹配而存在视觉捷径，使模型无需真正理解多模态知识即可取得高分，无法真实评估模型能力。

Method: 构建名为RETINA的新基准，利用大语言模型自动构建数据集，将问题指向次级相关实体并配以该实体图像；同时提出MIMIR模型，通过融合多个相关实体的图像来增强文档嵌入表示。

Result: 在RETINA上，现有模型性能大幅下降，证实其依赖视觉捷径；而MIMIR因引入多图像信息，在该基准上表现更优。

Conclusion: RETINA有效揭示了现有MKB-VQA基准的缺陷，MIMIR通过多图像增强策略提升了模型在无视觉捷径场景下的表现，推动了更鲁棒的多模态问答研究。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (MKB-VQA) benchmarks suffer from "visual shortcuts", as the query image typically matches the primary subject entity of the target document. We demonstrate that models can exploit these shortcuts, achieving comparable results using visual cues alone. To address this, we introduce Relational Entity Text-Image kNowledge Augmented (RETINA) benchmark, automatically constructed using an LLM-driven pipeline, consisting of 120k training and 2k human-curated test set. RETINA contains queries referencing secondary subjects (i.e. related entities) and pairs them with images of these related entities, removing the visual shortcut. When evaluated on RETINA existing models show significantly degraded performance, confirming their reliance on the shortcut. Furthermore, we propose Multi-Image MultImodal Retriever (MIMIR), which enriches document embeddings by augmenting images of multiple related entities, effectively handling RETINA, unlike prior work that uses only a single image per document. Our experiments validate the limitations of existing benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of RETINA and MIMIR. Our project is available at: Project Page.

TL;DR: 本文提出SLEUTH，一种多智能体框架，通过粗到精的协作机制提升视觉语言模型在长文档理解任务中的表现，实现当前最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在处理单页文档时表现良好，但在长文档场景下效果下降，主要因为线索分散于多页和多模态中，且冗长输入带来冗余信息干扰模型判断；尽管检索增强生成可缓解此问题，但检索结果仍包含大量冗余。

Method: SLEUTH是一个模型无关、可扩展的多智能体框架，协调一个检索器与四个协作智能体，采用由粗到细的流程：识别检索页面中的关键文本与视觉线索，过滤出如表格和图表等显著视觉证据，分析查询以制定推理策略，并最终合成一个精炼、证据密集的多模态上下文用于生成答案。

Result: 在多个长文档基准测试中，SLEUTH结合先进VLM主干模型后持续提升性能，达到当前最优结果；消融实验验证了各模块的有效性及分层精炼范式的益处。

Conclusion: SLEUTH有效解决了长文档理解中线索分散与输入冗余的问题，为多模态长文档任务提供了一个高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Document understanding is a long standing practical task. Vision Language Models (VLMs) have gradually become a primary approach in this domain, demonstrating effective performance on single page tasks. However, their effectiveness diminishes when handling long documents. In such scenarios, clues are often scattered across multiple pages and modalities, and redundancy from lengthy inputs can impair the models judgment. While retrieval augmented generation mitigates this issue by filtering for question relevant content, the retrieved results still contain substantial redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose SLEUTH, a multi agent framework. Concretely, SLEUTH orchestrates a retriever and four collaborative agents in a coarse to fine process. The framework identifies key textual and visual clues within the retrieved pages, filters for salient visual evidence such as tables and charts, and analyzes the query to devise a reasoning strategy. It ultimately synthesizes a distilled, evidence dense multimodal context to generate the final prediction. SLEUTH is model agnostic and scalable. When paired with advanced VLM backbones, it consistently improves performance on multiple long document benchmarks, achieving state of the art results. Ablation studies verify each modules effectiveness and confirm the benefits of our hierarchical refinement paradigm.

*Jiaye Wu,Saeed Hadadan,Geng Lin,Peihan Tu,Matthias Zwicker,David Jacobs,Roni Sengupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLOW is a global illumination-aware inverse rendering framework that improves reflectance estimation in indoor scenes by jointly optimizing geometry and reflectance using neural representations and specialized losses to handle challenges like inter-reflections and near-field lighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse rendering in indoor scenes suffers from ambiguity between reflectance and lighting, especially due to inter-reflections; co-located light-camera setups help but introduce new issues like dynamic shadows and moving specular highlights that existing methods cannot address.

Method: GLOW combines a neural implicit surface representation with a neural radiance cache to model global illumination, uses joint optimization of geometry and reflectance with tailored regularization and initialization, introduces a dynamic radiance cache for near-field lighting changes, and applies a surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to reduce specular artifacts.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that GLOW significantly outperforms previous methods in estimating material reflectance under both natural and co-located illumination conditions.

Conclusion: GLOW effectively addresses key challenges in inverse rendering of indoor scenes with co-located lighting, achieving more accurate reflectance estimation through its global illumination-aware design and novel components.

Abstract: Inverse rendering of indoor scenes remains challenging due to the ambiguity between reflectance and lighting, exacerbated by inter-reflections among multiple objects. While natural illumination-based methods struggle to resolve this ambiguity, co-located light-camera setups offer better disentanglement as lighting can be easily calibrated via Structure-from-Motion. However, such setups introduce additional complexities like strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, near-field lighting, and moving specular highlights, which existing approaches fail to handle. We present GLOW, a Global Illumination-aware Inverse Rendering framework designed to address these challenges. GLOW integrates a neural implicit surface representation with a neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination, jointly optimizing geometry and reflectance through carefully designed regularization and initialization. We then introduce a dynamic radiance cache that adapts to sharp lighting discontinuities from near-field motion, and a surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to suppress specular artifacts common in flashlight captures. Experiments show that GLOW substantially outperforms prior methods in material reflectance estimation under both natural and co-located illumination.

TL;DR: 本文提出CoordSpeaker框架，通过引入手势描述文本和条件潜在扩散模型，实现语义一致且节奏同步的协调性共语手势生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有共语手势生成方法受限于缺乏文本驱动的非自发性手势（如边说话边鞠躬），主要面临两个挑战：一是手势数据集中缺少描述性文本标注导致语义先验差距，二是难以实现多模态协调控制。

Method: 提出CoordSpeaker框架：首先构建新颖的手势字幕生成模块，利用运动-语言模型在多个粒度上生成描述性字幕以弥合语义先验差距；然后设计基于统一跨数据集运动表示和分层控制去噪器的条件潜在扩散模型，实现高度可控的协调手势生成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成与语音节奏同步、与任意字幕语义一致的高质量手势，在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoordSpeaker首次探索了通过手势理解与字幕生成来解决手势生成中的语义鸿沟问题，并提出了手势-文本双向映射的新视角，显著提升了共语手势生成的质量与可控性。

Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation has significantly advanced human-computer interaction, yet speaker movements remain constrained due to the omission of text-driven non-spontaneous gestures (e.g., bowing while talking). Existing methods face two key challenges: 1) the semantic prior gap due to the lack of descriptive text annotations in gesture datasets, and 2) the difficulty in achieving coordinated multimodal control over gesture generation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CoordSpeaker, a comprehensive framework that enables coordinated caption-empowered co-speech gesture synthesis. Our approach first bridges the semantic prior gap through a novel gesture captioning framework, leveraging a motion-language model to generate descriptive captions at multiple granularities. Building upon this, we propose a conditional latent diffusion model with unified cross-dataset motion representation and a hierarchically controlled denoiser to achieve highly controlled, coordinated gesture generation. CoordSpeaker pioneers the first exploration of gesture understanding and captioning to tackle the semantic gap in gesture generation while offering a novel perspective of bidirectional gesture-text mapping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality gestures that are both rhythmically synchronized with speeches and semantically coherent with arbitrary captions, achieving superior performance with higher efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: 由于跨被试/采集条件下BOLD信号的高维异质性以及缺乏基于神经科学的验证手段，生成受认知任务调控的全脑4D fMRI序列仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用扩散Transformer架构，结合3D VQ-GAN进行潜在空间压缩，使用CNN-Transformer混合主干，并通过AdaLN-Zero与交叉注意力实现强任务条件控制。

Result: 在HCP任务fMRI数据上，模型复现了任务诱发激活图，保留真实数据中的任务间表征结构（RSA），实现完美条件特异性，ROI时间序列与标准血流动力学响应高度对齐；任务激活图相关系数达0.83，RSA达0.98，全面优于U-Net基线。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将潜在扩散与可扩展主干及强条件机制相结合，为条件式4D fMRI合成提供了可行路径，有望支持虚拟实验、跨站点数据协调及下游神经影像模型的数据增强等应用。

Abstract: Generating whole-brain 4D fMRI sequences conditioned on cognitive tasks remains challenging due to the high-dimensional, heterogeneous BOLD dynamics across subjects/acquisitions and the lack of neuroscience-grounded validation. We introduce the first diffusion transformer for voxelwise 4D fMRI conditional generation, combining 3D VQ-GAN latent compression with a CNN-Transformer backbone and strong task conditioning via AdaLN-Zero and cross-attention. On HCP task fMRI, our model reproduces task-evoked activation maps, preserves the inter-task representational structure observed in real data (RSA), achieves perfect condition specificity, and aligns ROI time-courses with canonical hemodynamic responses. Performance improves predictably with scale, reaching task-evoked map correlation of 0.83 and RSA of 0.98, consistently surpassing a U-Net baseline on all metrics. By coupling latent diffusion with a scalable backbone and strong conditioning, this work establishes a practical path to conditional 4D fMRI synthesis, paving the way for future applications such as virtual experiments, cross-site harmonization, and principled augmentation for downstream neuroimaging models.

### [112] [ClearGCD: Mitigating Shortcut Learning For Robust Generalized Category Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22892)
*Kailin Lyu,Jianwei He,Long Xiao,Jianing Zeng,Liang Fan,Lin Shu,Jie Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClearGCD is a new framework for Generalized Category Discovery that reduces prototype confusion by suppressing shortcut learning through Semantic View Alignment and Shortcut Suppression Regularization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods suffer from prototype confusion due to reliance on non-semantic cues (shortcut learning), which harms generalization and causes forgetting of known classes in open-world settings.

Method: ClearGCD introduces two mechanisms: (1) Semantic View Alignment (SVA), which uses cross-class patch replacement for strong augmentations and enforces semantic consistency with weak augmentations; and (2) Shortcut Suppression Regularization (SSR), which maintains an adaptive prototype bank to align known classes and separate novel ones.

Result: ClearGCD consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks and can be easily integrated into existing parametric GCD approaches.

Conclusion: By mitigating shortcut learning through semantic alignment and adaptive prototype regularization, ClearGCD effectively improves both known-class retention and novel-category discovery in open-world scenarios.

Abstract: In open-world scenarios, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) requires identifying both known and novel categories within unlabeled data. However, existing methods often suffer from prototype confusion caused by shortcut learning, which undermines generalization and leads to forgetting of known classes. We propose ClearGCD, a framework designed to mitigate reliance on non-semantic cues through two complementary mechanisms. First, Semantic View Alignment (SVA) generates strong augmentations via cross-class patch replacement and enforces semantic consistency using weak augmentations. Second, Shortcut Suppression Regularization (SSR) maintains an adaptive prototype bank that aligns known classes while encouraging separation of potential novel ones. ClearGCD can be seamlessly integrated into parametric GCD approaches and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: 所提DM³T通过类扩散的迭代融合机制有效提升了多模态多目标跟踪的准确性与鲁棒性，为自动驾驶等应用提供了更可靠的感知方案。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision with critical applications in autonomous driving and robotics. Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on the VT-MOT benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 41.7 HOTA, representing a 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出Points-to-Clouds（P2C）框架，将多模态提示学习从静态点表示转变为语义云（分布）学习，通过受扩散模型启发的双重去噪机制提升视觉语言模型在基础类与新类别上的泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 现有MPL方法依赖单一静态点表示，易过拟合并难以泛化至新类别或模糊类别，因此需引入更鲁棒的语义表示方式。

Method: 提出P2C框架，包含动态提示去噪（DPD）机制和辅助的V-L映射器去噪损失：前者对文本提示施加退火噪声以学习平滑语义空间，后者将映射器重构为去噪自编码器，从含噪文本重建干净视觉提示。

Abstract: Multimodal Prompt Learning (MPL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for adapting large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs). However, current MPL methods are fundamentally limited by their optimization of a single, static point representation. This paradigm is inherently brittle, leads to overfitting on base classes, and generalizes poorly to novel or ambiguous categories. We challenge this point paradigm, proposing that robust generalization requires learning a semantic cloud (i.e., a distribution over the embedding space). To achieve this, we introduce Points-to-Clouds (P2C), a novel framework inspired by diffusion models that reframes prompt learning as a dynamic denoising task. At the core of P2C is a dual denoising mechanism: a Dynamic Prompt Denoising (DPD) mechanism perturbs text prompts with sophisticated, annealed noise to learn a smoother semantic landscape, while an auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder. This forces the mapper to reconstruct clean visual prompts from noisy text inputs, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that P2C consistently outperforms strong baselines. On the base-to-novel generalization benchmark, our method achieves a Harmonic Mean of 79.7%, representing a relative improvement of 1.4% over the baseline. The code and models are available at https://vranlee.github.io/P2C/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将文本查询与视频片段视为黑箱，忽略了单个词语的重要性，限制了上下文理解能力。

Method: 引入特征增强模块（FEM）提取查询中的关键词，并通过基于排序的过滤模块（RFM）迭代优化视频片段的相关性；同时利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）进行图文场景理解以增强语义表示。

Result: 在视频时刻检索和高亮检测任务上显著超越当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过细粒度关键词感知机制有效提升了视频-语言任务的性能，验证了对查询中重要词语建模的重要性。

Abstract: Video moment retrieval (MR) and highlight detection (HD) with natural language queries aim to localize relevant moments and key highlights in a video clips. However, existing methods overlook the importance of individual words, treating the entire text query and video clips as a black-box, which hinders contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enables fine-grained clip filtering by identifying and prioritizing important words in the query. Our method integrates image-text scene understanding through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enhances the semantic understanding of video clips. We introduce a feature enhancement module (FEM) to capture important words from the query and a ranking-based filtering module (RFM) to iteratively refine video clips based on their relevance to these important words. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both MR and HD tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出ViGG，一种基于视觉-几何互引导的鲁棒RGB-D点云配准方法，在多个数据集上优于现有先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D配准方法在利用图像信息方面存在局限，难以兼顾鲁棒性与实用性。

Method: 提出互引导策略：1）通过几何引导抑制模糊团（clique）以实现视觉-几何联合对齐；2）利用视觉先验缩小几何匹配搜索空间，提取高质量、抗噪的对应关系。

Result: 在3DMatch、ScanNet和KITTI数据集上的实验表明，ViGG在无学习和基于学习两种设置下均优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ViGG通过视觉与几何信息的相互引导，显著提升了RGB-D配准的鲁棒性和适用性。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D vision. Most existing methods only use geometric information for registration. Recently proposed RGB-D registration methods primarily focus on feature fusion or improving feature learning, which limits their ability to exploit image information and hinders their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose ViGG, a robust RGB-D registration method using mutual guidance. First, we solve clique alignment in a visual-geometric combination form, employing a geometric guidance design to suppress ambiguous cliques. Second, to mitigate accuracy degradation caused by noise in visual matches, we propose a visual-guided geometric matching method that utilizes visual priors to determine the search space, enabling the extraction of high-quality, noise-insensitive correspondences. This mutual guidance strategy brings our method superior robustness, making it applicable for various RGB-D registration tasks. The experiments on 3DMatch, ScanNet and KITTI datasets show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in both learning-free and learning-based settings.

*Sebastian Padó,Kerstin Thomas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了当前（2025年）视觉语言模型（VLMs）在识别艺术作品中情感表达方面的能力，发现其在具象图像上表现良好，但在高度抽象或象征性图像上存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于情感在艺术表达中的重要性和抽象性，以及其随历史变迁和需要艺术史专业知识进行分析的特点，作者希望评估现有视觉语言模型能否有效识别艺术作品中的情感内容及其表达方式。

Method: 作者对三种VLM（Llava-Llama 和两个Qwen模型）进行了案例研究，提出四类复杂度递增的问题（一般内容、情感内容、情感表达方式、情感符号），并由专家进行定性评估。

Result: 模型能较好地识别图像内容及所描绘的情感和表达方式，尤其在具象图像上表现优异；但在高度抽象或象征性图像上表现不佳，且对符号的可靠识别仍困难，同时存在大语言模型常见的回答不一致问题。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在理解艺术作品情感方面具有一定能力，但面对抽象与象征性内容仍有明显局限，尚不能替代艺术史专家的深度分析。

Abstract: Emotions are a fundamental aspect of artistic expression. Due to their abstract nature, there is a broad spectrum of emotion realization in artworks. These are subject to historical change and their analysis requires expertise in art history. In this article, we investigate which aspects of emotional expression can be detected by current (2025) vision language models (VLMs). We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult. Furthermore, the models continue to exhibit the well-known LLM weakness of providing inconsistent answers to related questions.

*Chuan Wang,Xi-le Zhao,Zhilong Han,Liang Li,Deyu Meng,Michael K. Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NeuMatC的神经矩阵计算框架，通过利用参数维度上的低秩性和连续性，实现对参数化矩阵运算（如求逆和SVD）的高效建模，在保持可接受精度的同时显著加速计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理随参数连续变化的矩阵运算时，未充分利用参数维度上的低秩性和连续性，导致大量冗余计算。

Method: NeuMatC通过无监督学习建立从参数到对应矩阵运算结果的低秩连续映射，训练后仅需少量基本操作（如矩阵乘法和非线性激活）即可在任意参数下高效计算。

Result: 在合成与真实数据集上的实验表明，NeuMatC在无线通信等任务中相比NumPy基线实现了超过3倍的参数化求逆加速和10倍的参数化SVD加速，同时保持了可接受的精度。

Conclusion: NeuMatC有效利用参数维度的结构特性，为重复性参数化矩阵运算提供了一种高效且准确的新范式。

Abstract: Matrix operations (e.g., inversion and singular value decomposition (SVD)) are fundamental in science and engineering. In many emerging real-world applications (such as wireless communication and signal processing), these operations must be performed repeatedly over matrices with parameters varying continuously. However, conventional methods tackle each matrix operation independently, underexploring the inherent low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension, resulting in significantly redundant computation. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{\textit{Neural Matrix Computation Framework} (NeuMatC)}, which elegantly tackles general parametric matrix operation tasks by leveraging the underlying low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension. Specifically, NeuMatC unsupervisedly learns a low-rank and continuous mapping from parameters to their corresponding matrix operation results. Once trained, NeuMatC enables efficient computations at arbitrary parameters using only a few basic operations (e.g., matrix multiplications and nonlinear activations), significantly reducing redundant computations. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the promising performance of NeuMatC, exemplified by over $3\times$ speedup in parametric inversion and $10\times$ speedup in parametric SVD compared to the widely used NumPy baseline in wireless communication, while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

Result: ReImage在多种篡改场景下均取得当前最优性能，能够稳定生成高质量的恢复图像。

Conclusion: 所提出的ReImage框架有效提升了图像自恢复的准确性与实用性，为应对AIGC带来的数字媒体真实性挑战提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) raises concerns about the authenticity of digital media. In this context, image self-recovery, reconstructing original content from its manipulated version, offers a practical solution for understanding the attacker's intent and restoring trustworthy data. However, existing methods often fail to accurately recover tampered regions, falling short of the primary goal of self-recovery. To address this challenge, we propose ReImage, a neural watermarking-based self-recovery framework that embeds a shuffled version of the target image into itself as a watermark. We design a generator that produces watermarks optimized for neural watermarking and introduce an image enhancement module to refine the recovered image. We further analyze and resolve key limitations of shuffled watermarking, enabling its effective use in self-recovery. We demonstrate that ReImage achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tampering scenarios, consistently producing high-quality recovered images. The code and pretrained models will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: DenoiseGS有效解决了高斯泼溅在噪声输入下重建质量下降的问题，兼顾效率与细节保留，为手持设备图像增强提供了高效可行的新方案。

Abstract: Burst denoising methods are crucial for enhancing images captured on handheld devices, but they often struggle with large motion or suffer from prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we propose DenoiseGS, the first framework to leverage the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting for burst denoising. Our approach addresses two key challenges when applying feedforward Gaussian reconsturction model to noisy inputs: the degradation of Gaussian point clouds and the loss of fine details. To this end, we propose a Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss, which regularizes the geometry predicted from noisy inputs with high-quality Gaussian point clouds. These point clouds are generated from clean inputs by the same model that we are training, thereby alleviating potential bias or domain gaps. Additionally, we introduce a log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss to strengthen supervision within the spectral domain, effectively preserving fine-grained details. The LWF loss adaptively weights frequency discrepancies in a logarithmic manner, emphasizing challenging high-frequency details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DenoiseGS significantly exceeds the state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on both burst denoising and novel view synthesis under noisy conditions, while achieving \textbf{250$\times$} faster inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在姿态驱动角色动画中受限于参考图像与目标姿态必须空间对齐且骨骼结构一致，难以处理任意布局或部分可见的参考图像，因此亟需一种能应对参考-姿态错位的统一动画生成方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have greatly improved pose-driven character animation. However, existing methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures. Handling reference-pose misalignment remains unsolved. To address this, we present One-to-All Animation, a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts. First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches. The code and model will be available at https://github.com/ssj9596/One-to-All-Animation.

*Taeyeong Kim,SeungJoon Lee,Jung Uk Kim,MyeongAh Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLEX-Seg is a novel domain generalization framework for semantic segmentation that leverages misalignment in diffusion-generated data through adaptive boundary learning and hardness-aware sampling, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain generalization in semantic segmentation suffers from domain shifts, especially under adverse conditions. Existing diffusion-based data generation methods introduce misalignment between images and masks, which typically harms performance.

Method: FLEX-Seg introduces three components: (1) Granular Adaptive Prototypes to capture multi-scale boundary features, (2) Uncertainty Boundary Emphasis that adjusts learning focus using prediction entropy, and (3) Hardness-Aware Sampling to prioritize difficult examples. It exploits misalignment instead of correcting it.

Result: FLEX-Seg achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 2.44% and 2.63% mIoU gains on ACDC and Dark Zurich respectively, across five real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Adaptive strategies that embrace imperfect synthetic data—such as controlled misalignment—can significantly enhance domain generalization in semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Domain generalization in semantic segmentation faces challenges from domain shifts, particularly under adverse conditions. While diffusion-based data generation methods show promise, they introduce inherent misalignment between generated images and semantic masks. This paper presents FLEX-Seg (FLexible Edge eXploitation for Segmentation), a framework that transforms this limitation into an opportunity for robust learning. FLEX-Seg comprises three key components: (1) Granular Adaptive Prototypes that captures boundary characteristics across multiple scales, (2) Uncertainty Boundary Emphasis that dynamically adjusts learning emphasis based on prediction entropy, and (3) Hardness-Aware Sampling that progressively focuses on challenging examples. By leveraging inherent misalignment rather than enforcing strict alignment, FLEX-Seg learns robust representations while capturing rich stylistic variations. Experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 2.44% and 2.63% mIoU gains on ACDC and Dark Zurich. Our findings validate that adaptive strategies for handling imperfect synthetic data lead to superior domain generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/FLEX-Seg.

Motivation: 尽管现代分割模型能力强大，但由于机器人本体多样性、外观模糊性、结构复杂性和快速形变等特点，准确分割机器人仍然具有挑战性。现有基础模型（如SAM 2）在处理机器人分割任务时存在缺乏对关节机器人的适应性、依赖人工提示以及需要逐帧标注等限制。

Method: RobotSeg基于SAM 2模型，引入三项关键技术：结构增强记忆关联器以捕捉机器人结构信息，机器人提示生成器实现自动提示，以及标签高效的训练策略减少对密集标注的依赖。同时构建了包含2.8k视频（138k帧）的VRS数据集用于训练与评估。

Result: 实验表明，RobotSeg在图像和视频机器人分割任务上均达到当前最优性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RobotSeg为机器人感知提供了一个结构感知、自动化且标签高效的分割基础模型，推动了机器人视觉理解的发展，并为未来研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Accurate robot segmentation is a fundamental capability for robotic perception. It enables precise visual servoing for VLA systems, scalable robot-centric data augmentation, accurate real-to-sim transfer, and reliable safety monitoring in dynamic human-robot environments. Despite the strong capabilities of modern segmentation models, surprisingly it remains challenging to segment robots. This is due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video. RobotSeg is built upon the versatile SAM 2 foundation model but addresses its three limitations for robot segmentation, namely the lack of adaptation to articulated robots, reliance on manual prompts, and the need for per-frame training mask annotations, by introducing a structure-enhanced memory associator, a robot prompt generator, and a label-efficient training strategy. These innovations collectively enable a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution. We further construct the video robot segmentation (VRS) dataset comprising over 2.8k videos (138k frames) with diverse robot embodiments and environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on both images and videos, establishing a strong foundation for future advances in robot perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VLM的3D场景理解方法通常在嵌入空间中隐式对齐3D特征，但由于3D数据稀缺和空间关系复杂，效果不佳。

Method: 提出一种层次化多模态表示方法，在输入空间显式对齐VLM：使用包含俯视图和四个方向视图的多视角图像，以及引用检测对象3D坐标的文本描述；同时引入层次化特征表示，将图像块级特征聚合为视图级和场景级表示。

Result: 在情境化3D问答和通用3D问答基准上的实验结果表明该方法有效。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过显式对齐多模态输入和层次化特征表示，显著提升了3D场景理解能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant promise for 3D scene understanding. Existing VLM-based approaches typically align 3D scene features with the VLM's embedding space. However, this implicit alignment often yields suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of 3D data and the inherent complexity of spatial relationships in 3D environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs at the input space by leveraging both multi-view images and text descriptions. The text descriptions capture spatial relationships by referencing the 3D coordinates of detected objects, while the multi-view images include a top-down perspective and four directional views (forward, left, right, and backward), ensuring comprehensive scene coverage. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical feature representation that aggregates patch-level image features into view-level and scene-level representations, enabling the model to reason over both local and global scene context. Experimental results on both situated 3D Q&A and general 3D Q&A benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的语义SLAM框架，通过引入内在外观归一化（IAN）模块和动态辐射平衡损失（DRB-Loss），有效提升了系统在极端光照条件下的鲁棒性，在公开数据集上实现了领先的相机跟踪、地图质量和语义几何精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端曝光会显著降低三维地图重建与语义分割的准确性，尤其对紧耦合系统影响严重，因此亟需提升系统在不同光照条件下的不变性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出包含两个核心设计的语义SLAM框架：1）内在外观归一化（IAN）模块，主动解耦场景固有属性（如反照率）与瞬时光照，学习标准化的光照不变外观模型；2）动态辐射平衡损失（DRB-Loss），仅在图像曝光不良时激活，直接作用于辐射场以引导针对性优化。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在相机跟踪、地图质量、语义和几何精度方面均达到当前最优水平。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过IAN的主动不变性与DRB-Loss的被动校正协同作用，显著增强了语义SLAM系统在极端光照下的鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Extreme exposure degrades both the 3D map reconstruction and semantic segmentation accuracy, which is particularly detrimental to tightly-coupled systems. To achieve illumination invariance, we propose a novel semantic SLAM framework with two designs. First, the Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) module proactively disentangles the scene's intrinsic properties, such as albedo, from transient lighting. By learning a standardized, illumination-invariant appearance model, it assigns a stable and consistent color representation to each Gaussian primitive. Second, the Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) reactively handles frames with extreme exposure. It activates only when an image's exposure is poor, operating directly on the radiance field to guide targeted optimization. This prevents error accumulation from extreme lighting without compromising performance under normal conditions. The synergy between IAN's proactive invariance and DRB-Loss's reactive correction endows our system with unprecedented robustness. Evaluations on public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in camera tracking, map quality, and semantic and geometric accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半自回归（块扩散）范式在生成分钟级长视频时仍面临两个关键挑战：一是KV缓存导致的长期误差累积，二是缺乏针对长视频的细粒度基准和考虑连贯性的评估指标。

Method: 提出BlockVid框架，包含语义感知稀疏KV缓存机制、名为Block Forcing的有效训练策略，以及专门设计的分块噪声调度与打乱方法，以减少误差传播并增强时间一致性；同时构建LV-Bench基准和新的长程连贯性评估指标。

Conclusion: BlockVid有效解决了长视频生成中的误差累积和评估缺失问题，显著提升了生成视频的质量与连贯性，为构建世界模型和高级AI模拟器提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Generating minute-long videos is a critical step toward developing world models, providing a foundation for realistic extended scenes and advanced AI simulators. The emerging semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) paradigm integrates the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling arbitrary-length video generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel sampling. However, it yet faces two enduring challenges: (i) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and (ii) the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks and coherence-aware metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BlockVid, a novel block diffusion framework equipped with semantic-aware sparse KV cache, an effective training strategy called Block Forcing, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to reduce error propagation and enhance temporal consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了MultiBanana，一个用于评估多参考图像生成模型能力的新基准，涵盖参考图像数量变化、域不匹配、尺度不一致、稀有概念和多语言文本等挑战，并对现有模型进行了系统分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成的基准数据集主要关注单张或少量参考图像，难以全面评估模型在多参考条件下的性能及其局限性；同时任务定义模糊，无法准确反映多参考场景的内在难度。

Method: 作者构建了MultiBanana基准，通过五个维度系统设计多参考生成任务：(1) 参考图像数量变化，(2) 参考图像间的域不匹配（如照片与动漫），(3) 参考与目标场景的尺度差异，(4) 包含稀有概念的参考（如红色香蕉），(5) 多语言文本参考。

Result: 对多种文本到图像模型的评估揭示了它们在多参考设置下的优异表现、典型失败模式及改进方向。

Conclusion: MultiBanana作为一个开放基准，有助于推动多参考图像生成技术的发展，并为公平比较提供标准化基础。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image generation models have acquired the ability of multi-reference generation and editing; the ability to inherit the appearance of subjects from multiple reference images and re-render them under new contexts. However, the existing benchmark datasets often focus on the generation with single or a few reference images, which prevents us from measuring the progress on how model performance advances or pointing out their weaknesses, under different multi-reference conditions. In addition, their task definitions are still vague, typically limited to axes such as "what to edit" or "how many references are given", and therefore fail to capture the intrinsic difficulty of multi-reference settings. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiBanana}$, which is carefully designed to assesses the edge of model capabilities by widely covering multi-reference-specific problems at scale: (1) varying the number of references, (2) domain mismatch among references (e.g., photo vs. anime), (3) scale mismatch between reference and target scenes, (4) references containing rare concepts (e.g., a red banana), and (5) multilingual textual references for rendering. Our analysis among a variety of text-to-image models reveals their superior performances, typical failure modes, and areas for improvement. MultiBanana will be released as an open benchmark to push the boundaries and establish a standardized basis for fair comparison in multi-reference image generation. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/matsuolab/multibanana .

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需重训练、特定条件或架构修改的谱弱化框架，用于提升视觉自回归模型在无条件和有条件生成中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无条件生成的引导机制依赖于扩散模型的特定假设，难以直接应用于自回归模型；作者旨在为视觉自回归模型设计一种通用且灵活的引导方法。

Method: 在谱域构建可控的弱模型，通过对内部表示的通道维度进行谱选择，并引入两种谱重归一化策略以确保数值稳定性，从而实现信息的可控减少。

Result: 在离散和连续自回归模型上进行的大量实验表明，该方法既能实现高质量的无条件生成，又能在有条件生成中保持良好的提示对齐能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的谱弱化框架有效突破了扩散模型结构限制，为自回归模型提供了一种通用、稳定且高效的引导机制。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become a widely adopted and practical approach for enhancing generation quality and improving condition alignment. Recent studies have explored guidance mechanisms for unconditional generation, yet these approaches remain fundamentally tied to assumptions specific to diffusion models. In this work, we propose a spectrum-weakening framework for visual autoregressive (AR) models. This method works without the need for re-training, specific conditions, or any architectural modifications. It achieves this by constructing a controllable weak model in the spectral domain. We theoretically show that invertible spectral transformations preserve information, while selectively retaining only a subset of spectrum introduces controlled information reduction. Based on this insight, we perform spectrum selection along the channel dimension of internal representations, which avoids the structural constraints imposed by diffusion models. We further introduce two spectrum renormalization strategies that ensures numerical stability during the weakening process. Extensive experiments were conducted on both discrete and continuous AR models, with text or class conditioning. The results demonstrate that our method enables high-quality unconditional generation while maintaining strong prompt alignment for conditional generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF和3DGS方法在多模态（特别是融合热红外）渲染方面研究不足，且忽视了热传导和朗伯特性等热成像关键物理特性。

Method: MrGS从单一外观特征中通过正交特征提取分别获取RGB和热信息，并根据各模态的朗伯反射程度采用视图相关或无关的嵌入策略；同时引入傅里叶热传导定律建模高斯点间的热传导效应，并结合斯特藩-玻尔兹曼定律与平方反比定律构建深度感知的热辐射图以增强几何约束。

Conclusion: MrGS成功将物理先验融入多模态3D重建，显著提升了热红外与可见光联合渲染的质量与效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved considerable performance in RGB scene reconstruction. However, multi-modal rendering that incorporates thermal infrared imagery remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches tend to neglect distinctive thermal characteristics, such as heat conduction and the Lambertian property. In this study, we introduce MrGS, a multi-modal radiance field based on 3DGS that simultaneously reconstructs both RGB and thermal 3D scenes. Specifically, MrGS derives RGB- and thermal-related information from a single appearance feature through orthogonal feature extraction and employs view-dependent or view-independent embedding strategies depending on the degree of Lambertian reflectance exhibited by each modality. Furthermore, we leverage two physics-based principles to effectively model thermal-domain phenomena. First, we integrate Fourier's law of heat conduction prior to alpha blending to model intensity interpolation caused by thermal conduction between neighboring Gaussians. Second, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the inverse-square law to formulate a depth-aware thermal radiation map that imposes additional geometric constraints on thermal rendering. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MrGS achieves high-fidelity RGB-T scene reconstruction while reducing the number of Gaussians.

TL;DR: 本文提出了JarvisEvo，一种统一的图像编辑智能体，通过多模态推理和自优化机制，有效缓解指令幻觉与奖励黑客问题，在ArtEdit-Bench上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于智能体的编辑模型存在两个关键问题：一是文本链式推理无法完全避免因信息瓶颈导致的指令幻觉；二是动态策略优化易利用静态奖励函数的缺陷，产生奖励黑客行为。

Method: JarvisEvo引入三项核心技术：1）交错多模态链式思维（iMCoT）提升指令遵循与编辑质量；2）编辑器-评估器协同策略优化（SEPO）框架实现无外部奖励的自提升；3）无缝集成Adobe Lightroom以支持全局与局部精细编辑。

Result: 在ArtEdit-Bench基准上，JarvisEvo在保留性编辑指标上平均优于Nano-Banana 18.95%，其中像素级内容保真度提升达44.96%。

Conclusion: JarvisEvo通过模拟人类设计师的迭代编辑与反思过程，有效解决了现有智能体编辑模型中的指令幻觉和奖励黑客问题，显著提升了图像编辑的质量与可靠性。

Abstract: Agent-based editing models have substantially advanced interactive experiences, processing quality, and creative flexibility. However, two critical challenges persist: (1) instruction hallucination, text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning cannot fully prevent factual errors due to inherent information bottlenecks; (2) reward hacking, dynamic policy optimization against static reward models allows agents to exploit flaws in reward functions. To address these issues, we propose JarvisEvo, a unified image editing agent that emulates an expert human designer by iteratively editing, selecting appropriate tools, evaluating results, and reflecting on its own decisions to refine outcomes. JarvisEvo offers three key advantages: (1) an interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought (iMCoT) reasoning mechanism that enhances instruction following and editing quality; (2) a synergistic editor-evaluator policy optimization (SEPO) framework that enables self-improvement without external rewards, effectively mitigating reward hacking; and (3) support for both global and local fine-grained editing through seamless integration of Adobe Lightroom. On ArtEdit-Bench, JarvisEvo outperforms Nano-Banana by an average of 18.95% on preservative editing metrics, including a substantial 44.96% improvement in pixel-level content fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出GC-4DGS，一种在稀疏输入视角下实现高质量、实时动态场景渲染的新框架，通过引入几何一致性提升4D高斯泼溅（4DGS）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态高斯泼溅方法在输入视角稀疏时性能显著下降，主要由于4D几何学习不一致，限制了其在AIoT等实际场景中的应用。

Method: 提出动态一致性检查策略以降低多视角立体匹配（MVS）在时空中的估计不确定性，并设计全局-局部深度正则化方法，从单目深度中提取时空一致的几何信息，增强4D体积内几何与外观的一致性学习。

Result: 在N3DV和Technicolor数据集上的实验表明，GC-4DGS在保持高效的同时显著提升渲染质量，PSNR分别比RF-DeRF和原始4DGS高出2.62dB和1.58dB，并可在资源受限的IoT边缘设备上无缝部署。

Conclusion: GC-4DGS有效解决了稀疏输入下动态场景4D高斯泼溅的几何不一致问题，在渲染质量和效率之间取得良好平衡，具有良好的实际应用前景。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has been considered as a novel way for view synthesis of dynamic scenes, which shows great potential in AIoT applications such as digital twins. However, recent dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods significantly degrade when only sparse input views are available, limiting their applicability in practice. The issue arises from the incoherent learning of 4D geometry as input views decrease. This paper presents GC-4DGS, a novel framework that infuses geometric consistency into 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), offering real-time and high-quality dynamic scene rendering from sparse input views. While learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and monocular depth estimators (MDEs) provide geometry priors, directly integrating these with 4DGS yields suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-input 4D geometric optimization. To address these problems, we introduce a dynamic consistency checking strategy to reduce estimation uncertainties of MVS across spacetime. Furthermore, we propose a global-local depth regularization approach to distill spatiotemporal-consistent geometric information from monocular depths, thereby enhancing the coherent geometry and appearance learning within the 4D volume. Extensive experiments on the popular N3DV and Technicolor datasets validate the effectiveness of GC-4DGS in rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency. Notably, our method outperforms RF-DeRF, the latest dynamic radiance field tailored for sparse-input dynamic view synthesis, and the original 4DGS by 2.62dB and 1.58dB in PSNR, respectively, with seamless deployability on resource-constrained IoT edge devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GOATex 是一种基于扩散模型的3D网格纹理生成方法，通过引入遮挡感知机制和分层可见性控制，实现了对物体内外表面的高质量、无缝纹理生成，无需微调预训练模型，并支持对外部和内部区域分别进行提示控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D纹理方法在处理被遮挡的内部表面时存在不足，导致纹理不完整和接缝明显。为解决这一问题，作者提出一种能同时处理外表面与内表面纹理的新方法。

Method: GOATex 利用多视角光线投射计算网格面的“命中层级”（hit levels），将网格划分为从外到内的可见性层级；采用两阶段可见性控制策略逐步揭示内部结构，并使用预训练扩散模型逐层生成纹理；最后通过软UV空间融合技术，依据视点相关的可见性置信度加权合并各层纹理。

Result: 实验表明，GOATex 在可见与遮挡区域均能生成高保真、无缝的纹理，性能优于现有方法，且无需对扩散模型进行昂贵的微调。

Conclusion: GOATex 提出了一种高效、可控且无需微调的3D网格内外表面纹理生成框架，在质量和完整性方面显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: We present GOATex, a diffusion-based method for 3D mesh texturing that generates high-quality textures for both exterior and interior surfaces. While existing methods perform well on visible regions, they inherently lack mechanisms to handle occluded interiors, resulting in incomplete textures and visible seams. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware texturing framework based on the concept of hit levels, which quantify the relative depth of mesh faces via multi-view ray casting. This allows us to partition mesh faces into ordered visibility layers, from outermost to innermost. We then apply a two-stage visibility control strategy that progressively reveals interior regions with structural coherence, followed by texturing each layer using a pretrained diffusion model. To seamlessly merge textures obtained across layers, we propose a soft UV-space blending technique that weighs each texture's contribution based on view-dependent visibility confidence. Empirical results demonstrate that GOATex consistently outperforms existing methods, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures across both visible and occluded surfaces. Unlike prior works, GOATex operates entirely without costly fine-tuning of a pretrained diffusion model and allows separate prompting for exterior and interior mesh regions, enabling fine-grained control over layered appearances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于NeRF的3D场景重建中，野外采集的图像质量参差不齐，包含遮挡和瞬态物体，导致不同输入对最终重建结果的贡献不均，因此需要一种方法来量化每张图像的个体贡献以支持数据估值与优化。

Method: 通过基于PSNR和MSE的重建质量指标，评估每张输入图像对NeRF重建结果的个体贡献；并通过在训练过程中移除低贡献图像，观察重建保真度的变化来验证该方法的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法能够有效识别并剔除对重建贡献较低的图像，且在移除这些图像后重建质量仍保持稳定或仅轻微下降，验证了该贡献度量方法的合理性。

Conclusion: 该方法为NeRF重建中的图像数据估值提供了可行方案，有助于优化训练数据集、提升重建效率，并为数据货币化提供技术基础。

Abstract: Data valuation and monetization are becoming increasingly important across domains such as eXtended Reality (XR) and digital media. In the context of 3D scene reconstruction from a set of images -- whether casually or professionally captured -- not all inputs contribute equally to the final output. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) enable photorealistic 3D reconstruction of scenes by optimizing a volumetric radiance field given a set of images. However, in-the-wild scenes often include image captures of varying quality, occlusions, and transient objects, resulting in uneven utility across inputs. In this paper we propose a method to quantify the individual contribution of each image to NeRF-based reconstructions of in-the-wild image sets. Contribution is assessed through reconstruction quality metrics based on PSNR and MSE. We validate our approach by removing low-contributing images during training and measuring the resulting impact on reconstruction fidelity.

Motivation: 特应性皮炎缺乏客观诊断方法，易与银屑病混淆，且现有研究依赖高质量皮肤镜图像，难以在临床实际中获取；同时，现有系统需兼顾准确性和快速响应。

Method: 提出一种基于集成学习的皮肤病变检测系统（ENSEL），整合多种深度学习模型以提升诊断准确性，并使用真实用户拍摄的皮肤病变图像进行实验验证。

Result: ENSEL在大多数图像上实现了高召回率，处理速度低于1秒。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于实现皮肤病变的客观诊断，并推动数字医疗的发展。

Abstract: The amendments made to the Data 3 Act and impact of COVID-19 have fostered the growth of digital healthcare market and promoted the use of medical data in artificial intelligence in South Korea. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is diagnosed via subjective evaluations without using objective diagnostic methods, thereby increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. It is also similar to psoriasis in appearance, further complicating its accurate diagnosis. Existing studies on skin diseases have used high-quality dermoscopic image datasets, but such high-quality images cannot be obtained in actual clinical settings. Moreover, existing systems must ensure accuracy and fast response times. To this end, an ensemble learning-based skin lesion detection system (ENSEL) was proposed herein. ENSEL enhanced diagnostic accuracy by integrating various deep learning models via an ensemble approach. Its performance was verified by conducting skin lesion detection experiments using images of skin lesions taken by actual users. Its accuracy and response time were measured using randomly sampled skin disease images. Results revealed that ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and less than 1s s processing speed. This study contributes to the objective diagnosis of skin lesions and promotes the advancement of digital healthcare.

Result: 实验表明 NumeriKontrol 能在多种属性编辑场景中实现准确、连续且稳定的数值控制，显著提升编辑精度与交互性。

Conclusion: NumeriKontrol 通过引入数值化控制机制，推动了指令式图像编辑向更精确、可扩展和用户可控的方向发展。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing enables intuitive manipulation through natural language commands. However, text instructions alone often lack the precision required for fine-grained control over edit intensity. We introduce NumeriKontrol, a framework that allows users to precisely adjust image attributes using continuous scalar values with common units. NumeriKontrol encodes numeric editing scales via an effective Numeric Adapter and injects them into diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner. Thanks to a task-separated design, our approach supports zero-shot multi-condition editing, allowing users to specify multiple instructions in any order. To provide high-quality supervision, we synthesize precise training data from reliable sources, including high-fidelity rendering engines and DSLR cameras. Our Common Attribute Transform (CAT) dataset covers diverse attribute manipulations with accurate ground-truth scales, enabling NumeriKontrol to function as a simple yet powerful interactive editing studio. Extensive experiments show that NumeriKontrol delivers accurate, continuous, and stable scale control across a wide range of attribute editing scenarios. These contributions advance instruction-based image editing by enabling precise, scalable, and user-controllable image manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在多模态数学推理中表现良好，但尚不清楚视觉信息是否真正被有效利用，还是仅依赖语言先验知识，因此需要一个能解耦并量化视觉输入作用的基准。

Method: 构建MathSight基准，包含大学水平数学题，每题提供原始、手绘、拍照等多种视觉版本及纯文本条件，用于控制变量比较；在主流VLM上进行实验评估。

Result: 实验显示，随着题目难度增加，视觉信息的贡献减弱；Qwen3-VL在无图像输入时表现优于其多模态版本及GPT-5。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在复杂数学推理中并未有效利用视觉信息，未来需借助如MathSight等基准推动真正基于视觉的推理能力发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal mathematical reasoning. Yet, how much visual information truly contributes to reasoning remains unclear. Existing benchmarks report strong overall performance but seldom isolate the role of the image modality, leaving open whether VLMs genuinely leverage visual understanding or merely depend on linguistic priors. To address this, we present MathSight, a university-level multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark designed to disentangle and quantify the effect of visual input. Each problem includes multiple visual variants -- original, hand-drawn, photo-captured -- and a text-only condition for controlled comparison. Experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent trend: the contribution of visual information diminishes with increasing problem difficulty. Remarkably, Qwen3-VL without any image input surpasses both its multimodal variants and GPT-5, underscoring the need for benchmarks like MathSight to advance genuine vision-grounded reasoning in future models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为db-SP的稀疏感知序列并行技术，通过双层级划分和动态并行度调整，有效缓解了在扩散Transformer（DiT）中使用块稀疏注意力时因负载不均衡导致的推理延迟问题，在端到端和注意力模块上分别实现了1.25倍和1.40倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉生成任务中，对扩散Transformer（DiT）进行序列并行推理是降低延迟的关键，但当模型采用块稀疏注意力机制时，由于不同注意力头之间稀疏性差异以及稀疏掩码中密集块分布不均，导致严重的负载不均衡问题，限制了并行效率。

Result: 实验表明，db-SP相比当前最先进的序列并行方法，在端到端推理上平均提速1.25倍，注意力模块提速1.40倍。

Conclusion: db-SP是一种高效的稀疏感知序列并行技术，能显著提升基于块稀疏注意力的DiT模型的推理效率，具有低开销和良好适应性。

Abstract: Scaling Diffusion Transformer (DiT) inference via sequence parallelism is critical for reducing latency in visual generation, but is severely hampered by workload imbalance when applied to models employing block-wise sparse attention. The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that db-SP delivers an end-to-end speedup of 1.25x and an attention-specific speedup of 1.40x over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

Conclusion: 通过结合语言建模与图像情感理解，ACIEC 方法有效解决了情感鸿沟问题，为图像情感分类提供了新思路，并验证了文本信息在该任务中的关键作用。

Abstract: Image emotion classification (IEC) is a longstanding research field that has received increasing attention with the rapid progress of deep learning. Although recent advances have leveraged the knowledge encoded in pre-trained visual models, their effectiveness is constrained by the "affective gap" , limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for IEC tasks. It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the "affective gap". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can effectively bridge the affective gap and achieve superior results on multiple benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明，DualCamCtrl相比先前方法将摄像机运动误差降低40%以上，显著提升生成视频与指定摄像机轨迹的一致性。

Conclusion: DualCamCtrl通过联合建模RGB与深度信息并引入语义引导对齐机制，有效增强了摄像机控制视频生成中的几何一致性与可控性。

Abstract: This paper presents DualCamCtrl, a novel end-to-end diffusion model for camera-controlled video generation. Recent works have advanced this field by representing camera poses as ray-based conditions, yet they often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness. DualCamCtrl specifically targets this limitation by introducing a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences. To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose the Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism, which performs RGB-depth fusion in a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangle appearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories. Additionally, we analyze and reveal the distinct influence of depth and camera poses across denoising stages and further demonstrate that early and late stages play complementary roles in forming global structure and refining local details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualCamCtrl achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation, with over 40\% reduction in camera motion errors compared with prior methods.

TL;DR: InstanceV 是一个新型文本到视频生成框架，通过引入实例级控制机制和全局语义一致性模块，在提升视频整体质量的同时，实现了对生成视频中特定实例的位置、属性等细粒度控制，并提出了新的评估基准 InstanceBench。

Conclusion: InstanceV 成功实现了高可控性的实例级视频生成，同时保持甚至提升了整体视频质量，为细粒度可控视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality videos conditioned on textual descriptions. However, most existing text-to-video models rely solely on textual conditions, lacking general fine-grained controllability over video generation. To address this challenge, we propose InstanceV, a video generation framework that enables i) instance-level control and ii) global semantic consistency. Specifically, with the aid of proposed Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention mechanism, InstanceV maximizes the utilization of additional instance-level grounding information to generate correctly attributed instances at designated spatial locations. To improve overall consistency, We introduce the Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement module, which connects local instances with global semantics in a parameter-efficient manner. Furthermore, we incorporate Spatially-Aware Unconditional Guidance during both training and inference to alleviate the disappearance of small instances. Finally, we propose a new benchmark, named InstanceBench, which combines general video quality metrics with instance-aware metrics for more comprehensive evaluation on instance-level video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstanceV not only achieves remarkable instance-level controllability in video generation, but also outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both general quality and instance-aware metrics across qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Document rectification in real-world scenarios poses significant challenges due to extreme variations in camera perspectives and physical distortions. Driven by the insight that complex transformations can be decomposed and resolved progressively, we introduce a novel multi-stage framework that progressively reverses distinct distortion types in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, our framework first performs a global affine transformation to correct perspective distortions arising from the camera's viewpoint, then rectifies geometric deformations resulting from physical paper curling and folding, and finally employs a content-aware iterative process to eliminate fine-grained content distortions. To address limitations in existing evaluation protocols, we also propose two enhanced metrics: layout-aligned OCR metrics (AED/ACER) for a stable assessment that decouples geometric rectification quality from the layout analysis errors of OCR engines, and masked AD/AAD (AD-M/AAD-M) tailored for accurately evaluating geometric distortions in documents with incomplete boundaries. Extensive experiments show that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks, yielding a substantial reduction of 14.1\%--34.7\% in the AAD metric and demonstrating superior efficacy in real-world applications. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/chaoyunwang/ArbDR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RA-RFT的方法，用于提升视频时序定位（VTG）模型对“硬无关”自然语言查询的拒识能力，并构建了包含此类查询的新数据集HI-VTG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VTG模型假设每个查询在视频中都有对应片段，无法有效拒绝与视频语义相似但实际无关的“硬无关”查询。

Method: 基于GRPO框架，引入包含格式、拒识IoU、解释性和查询修正四项奖励目标的强化微调策略RA-RFT，并构建HI-VTG数据集支持训练。

Result: 在多种相关性感知VTG场景（包括硬无关、简单打乱和人工标注设置）中验证了方法的有效性，并展示了其在不同LVLM-based VTG模型上的可扩展性。

Conclusion: RA-RFT显著提升了VTG模型对硬无关查询的识别与拒识能力，增强了模型的相关性判断和细粒度语义推理性能。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize a temporal segment in a video corresponding to a natural language query. However, existing VTG models assume that a relevant segment always exists, causing them to always predict a target segment even when the query is irrelevant to the video. While recent approaches attempt to handle irrelevant queries, they can only reject those that are entirely unrelated to the video and still fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries that are semantically similar but not actually relevant. To address this, we propose Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) to effectively refuse hard-irrelevant queries in VTG. Our method is based on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and integrates four reward objectives-format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction-to improve both relevance discrimination and fine-grained semantic reasoning. In addition, to effectively support RA-RFT, we construct a Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset, which includes hard-irrelevant queries and their refusal answers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios, including hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, and human-annotated RA-VTG settings. We also show that the proposed method is scalable by applying it to various LVLM-based VTG models. Our code is available at https://github.com/JINSUBY/RA-RFT.

Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉跨越多个图像区域的组合语义，限制了细粒度视觉-语言理解能力。

Method: 提出PowerCLIP框架，利用幂集对齐优化图像区域子集与文本短语解析树之间的对比损失，并引入非线性聚合器（NLA）将计算复杂度从O(2^M)降至O(M)，同时保持高精度近似。

Result: 在零样本分类和检索任务中，PowerCLIP显著优于当前最先进的方法，验证了其组合性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PowerCLIP通过高效的幂集对齐机制有效提升了模型对跨区域组合语义的理解能力，为视觉-语言预训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language pre-training frameworks such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance across a range of vision-language tasks. Recent studies have shown that aligning individual text tokens with specific image patches or regions enhances fine-grained compositional understanding. However, it remains challenging to capture compositional semantics that span multiple image regions. To address this limitation, we propose PowerCLIP, a novel contrastive pre-training framework enhanced by powerset alignment, which exhaustively optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing the loss defined between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. Since the naive powerset construction incurs exponential computational cost due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of region subsets, we introduce efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) that reduce complexity from O(2^M) to O(M) with respect to the number of regions M, while approximating the exact loss value with arbitrary precision. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, underscoring the compositionality and robustness of our approach. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文提出ViP3DE方法，利用预训练视频生成模型的时间一致性先验，在单次前向传播中实现高质量、多视角一致的文本驱动3D编辑。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动3D编辑方法因缺乏多视角一致性先验，依赖逐视图2D编辑并进行耗时的2D-3D-2D迭代更新，易导致结果过度平滑且效率低下。

Method: 提出ViP3DE方法：1）以单个编辑视图为条件，利用视频生成模型生成其他一致的编辑视图；2）引入姿态保留的噪声混合策略，使生成视图匹配指定相机位姿；3）结合3D几何先验进行几何感知去噪，增强多视角一致性。

Conclusion: 通过引入视频生成模型的时间一致性先验和几何感知机制，ViP3DE有效解决了现有方法在效率和多视角一致性方面的不足，为文本驱动3D编辑提供了高效新范式。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing enables user-friendly 3D object or scene editing with text instructions. Due to the lack of multi-view consistency priors, existing methods typically resort to employing 2D generation or editing models to process each view individually, followed by iterative 2D-3D-2D updating. However, these methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to over-smoothed results because the different editing signals gathered from different views are averaged during the iterative process. In this paper, we propose generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) to employ the temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass. Our key insight is to condition the video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for 3D updating directly, thereby bypassing the iterative editing paradigm. Since 3D updating requires edited views to be paired with specific camera poses, we propose motion-preserved noise blending for the video model to generate edited views at predefined camera poses. In addition, we introduce geometry-aware denoising to further enhance multi-view consistency by integrating 3D geometric priors into video models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ViP3DE can achieve high-quality 3D editing results even within a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed.

Conclusion: 通过释放几何模型潜力并融合多帧几何信息，GeoWorld有效解决了图像到3D生成中的几何失真与模糊问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Previous works leveraging video models for image-to-3D scene generation tend to suffer from geometric distortions and blurry content. In this paper, we renovate the pipeline of image-to-3D scene generation by unlocking the potential of geometry models and present our GeoWorld. Instead of exploiting geometric information obtained from a single-frame input, we propose to first generate consecutive video frames and then take advantage of the geometry model to provide full-frame geometry features, which contain richer information than single-frame depth maps or camera embeddings used in previous methods, and use these geometry features as geometrical conditions to aid the video generation model. To enhance the consistency of geometric structures, we further propose a geometry alignment loss to provide the model with real-world geometric constraints and a geometry adaptation module to ensure the effective utilization of geometry features. Extensive experiments show that our GeoWorld can generate high-fidelity 3D scenes from a single image and a given camera trajectory, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Motivation: 当前高性能的病理学基础模型参数量庞大、嵌入维度高，在计算资源受限的情况下难以应用于研究或临床场景，因此需要一种高效压缩模型的方法。

Method: 提出Pathryoshka框架，结合RADIO蒸馏和Matryoshka表示学习思想，采用多教师蒸馏策略，实现模型尺寸压缩与灵活嵌入维度支持。

Result: 在十个公开病理学基准任务上评估显示，Pathryoshka相比其大型教师模型减小了86–92%的模型大小，性能相当；且在相同规模下，比现有单教师蒸馏模型平均准确率高出7.0个百分点。

Conclusion: Pathryoshka在不牺牲准确性和表示能力的前提下，实现了病理学基础模型的高效本地部署，有助于推动先进模型在更广泛研究与临床社区中的普及应用。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (FMs) have driven significant progress in computational pathology. However, these high-performing models can easily exceed a billion parameters and produce high-dimensional embeddings, thus limiting their applicability for research or clinical use when computing resources are tight. Here, we introduce Pathryoshka, a multi-teacher distillation framework inspired by RADIO distillation and Matryoshka Representation Learning to reduce pathology FM sizes while allowing for adaptable embedding dimensions. We evaluate our framework with a distilled model on ten public pathology benchmarks with varying downstream tasks. Compared to its much larger teachers, Pathryoshka reduces the model size by 86-92% at on-par performance. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-teacher distillation models of comparable size by a median margin of 7.0 in accuracy. By enabling efficient local deployment without sacrificing accuracy or representational richness, Pathryoshka democratizes access to state-of-the-art pathology FMs for the broader research and clinical community.

Abstract: Early-stage visual quality inspection is vital for achieving Zero-Defect Manufacturing and minimizing production waste in modern industrial environments. However, the complexity of robust visual inspection systems and their extensive data requirements hinder widespread adoption in semi-controlled industrial settings. In this context, we propose a pose-agnostic, zero-shot quality inspection framework that compares real scenes against real-time Digital Twins (DT) in the RGB-D space. Our approach enables efficient real-time DT rendering by semantically describing industrial scenes through object detection and pose estimation of known Computer-Aided Design models. We benchmark tools for real-time, multimodal RGB-D DT creation while tracking consumption of computational resources. Additionally, we provide an extensible and hierarchical annotation strategy for multi-criteria defect detection, unifying pose labelling with logical and structural defect annotations. Based on an automotive use case featuring the quality inspection of an axial flux motor, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our results demonstrate detection performace, achieving intersection-over-union (IoU) scores of up to 63.3% compared to ground-truth masks, even if using simple distance measurements under semi-controlled industrial conditions. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on generalizable, low-data defect detection methods in dynamic manufacturing settings.

Abstract: Tabular instruction tuning has emerged as a promising research direction for improving LLMs understanding of tabular data. However, the majority of existing works only consider question-answering and reasoning tasks over tabular data, leaving tabular data generation largely unnoticed. In this work, for the first time, we explore the efficacy of instruction tuning in improving LLMs tabular data generation capabilities. More specifically, given the high data and computation requirements of tabular instruction tuning, we aim to address the possibility of instruction tuning for tabular data generation with limited data and computational resources. To achieve this, we first create a high-quality instruction dataset for tabular data, enabling efficient LLM comprehension. We then instruction-tune an open-source LLM (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct) on the training set of this dataset to improve its tabular data generation performance. Our experimental results show that by using our high-quality dataset and instruction-tuning on only 7K instructions with an A100 GPU, for less than 6 hours, we achieve tabular data generation performance on par with the most capable commercial LLM, GPT-4o.

Conclusion: 增强3DGS光栅化过程对参数误差的鲁棒性是提升SLAM跟踪性能的关键，所提CB-KNN方法有效实现了这一目标，且易于集成到现有框架中。

Abstract: In this paper, we challenge the conventional notion in 3DGS-SLAM that rendering quality is the primary determinant of tracking accuracy. We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, while maintaining the overall quality of the scene reconstruction (mapping), significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking.

Abstract: Accurate detection of tea leaf pests and diseases in real plantations remains challenging due to complex backgrounds, variable illumination, and frequent occlusions among dense branches and leaves. Existing detectors often suffer from missed detections and false positives in such scenarios. To address these issues, we propose DAONet-YOLOv8, an enhanced YOLOv8 variant with three key improvements: (1) a Dual-Attention Fusion Module (DAFM) that combines convolutional local feature extraction with self-attention based global context modeling to focus on subtle lesion regions while suppressing background noise; (2) an occlusion-aware detection head (Detect-OAHead) that learns the relationship between visible and occluded parts to compensate for missing lesion features; and (3) a C2f-DSConv module employing dynamic synthesis convolutions with multiple kernel shapes to better capture irregular lesion boundaries. Experiments on our real-world tea plantation dataset containing six pest and disease categories demonstrate that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves 92.97% precision, 92.80% recall, 97.10% mAP@50 and 76.90% mAP@50:95, outperforming the YOLOv8n baseline by 2.34, 4.68, 1.40 and 1.80 percentage points respectively, while reducing parameters by 16.7%. Comparative experiments further confirm that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves superior performance over mainstream detection models.

Abstract: Functionality understanding in 3D, which aims to identify the functional element in a 3D scene to complete an action (e.g., the correct handle to "Open the second drawer of the cabinet near the bed"), is hindered by the scarcity of real-world data due to the substantial effort needed for its collection and annotation. To address this, we introduce SynthFun3D, the first method for task-based 3D scene synthesis. Given the action description, SynthFun3D generates a 3D indoor environment using a furniture asset database with part-level annotation, ensuring the action can be accomplished. It reasons about the action to automatically identify and retrieve the 3D mask of the correct functional element, enabling the inexpensive and large-scale generation of high-quality annotated data. We validate SynthFun3D through user studies, which demonstrate improved scene-prompt coherence compared to other approaches. Our quantitative results further show that the generated data can either replace real data with minor performance loss or supplement real data for improved performance, thereby providing an inexpensive and scalable solution for data-hungry 3D applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的推理时方法MRRE，通过在特定层注入预计算向量，提升大语言模型在低资源语言中的推理能力并保持输入输出语言一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型和视觉语言模型在英语中表现优异，但在低资源语言中性能显著下降，而现有改进方法要么依赖昂贵的多语言训练，要么依赖外部翻译工具，存在资源消耗大和对翻译质量敏感的问题。

Method: 提出MRRE方法，在推理过程中依次注入两类预计算向量：跨语言推理增强向量（将非英语推理表示引导至英语空间）和目标语言输出锚定向量（恢复目标语言分布以保持语言一致性），无需额外训练数据或工具。

Result: 在6个先进模型和4个推理基准上的实验表明，MRRE平均提升非英语推理能力5.48%，在泰语和斯瓦希里语等低资源语言中最高提升7.54%，同时提升输入输出语言一致性3.78%。

Conclusion: MRRE是一种高效、无需训练的推理时方法，能显著提升大模型在低资源语言中的推理性能并保持语言一致性，为多语言公平性提供新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities, yet their performance in English significantly outperforms that in low-resource languages, raising fairness concerns in multilingual applications. Existing approaches either rely on costly multilingual training or employ prompting with external translation tools, both of which are resource-intensive and sensitive to translation quality. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time method to enhance Multilingual Reasoning capabilities via Representation Engineering (MRRE) without using any additional training data or tools. MRRE sequentially injects two precomputed vectors at specific layers during inference processing: cross-lingual reasoning enhancement vectors, which steer non-English reasoning representations toward English space to unlock multilingual reasoning, and target-language output anchoring vectors, which restore the distribution of the target language to preserve input-output language consistency. Comprehensive experiments across six advanced LLMs and LVLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MRRE consistently enhances non-English reasoning by an average gain of 5.48% and up to 7.54% in low-resource languages (Thai and Swahili), while improving input-output language consistency by 3.78%.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了多种域随机化（DR）与域自适应（DA）方法在无标注合成数据生成中的效果，发现基于简单特征（如感知哈希）的方法在准确性和效率上优于复杂的生成式AI方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低工业和机器人场景中机器学习部署所需的数据生成与标注成本，同时有效弥合仿真到现实（sim-to-real）的差距。

Method: 对包括基于特征的方法、生成式AI（GenAI）和传统渲染在内的多种DR与DA技术进行基准测试；重点评估低层与高层特征对齐效果，并引入由真实场景提示引导的可控扩散DA方法；在私有工业数据集（汽车与物流）和公开机器人数据集上验证。

Result: 当具备足够多样性的渲染数据作为种子时，基于亮度和感知哈希的简单特征方法优于复杂GenAI方法；感知哈希在工业和机器人数据集上分别达到98%和67%的mAP50；GenAI方法在数据生成上耗时显著，但未带来mAP提升。

Conclusion: 使用高变异性渲染数据结合简单特征对齐方法（如感知哈希），可高效弥合sim-to-real差距，实现仅用合成数据训练的模型在真实世界中的高性能表现。

Abstract: Reducing the burden of data generation and annotation remains a major challenge for the cost-effective deployment of machine learning in industrial and robotics settings. While synthetic rendering is a promising solution, bridging the sim-to-real gap often requires expert intervention. In this work, we benchmark a range of domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques, including feature-based methods, generative AI (GenAI), and classical rendering approaches, for creating contextualized synthetic data without manual annotation. Our evaluation focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency of low-level and high-level feature alignment, as well as a controlled diffusion-based DA method guided by prompts generated from real-world contexts. We validate our methods on two datasets: a proprietary industrial dataset (automotive and logistics) and a public robotics dataset. Results show that if render-based data with enough variability is available as seed, simpler feature-based methods, such as brightness-based and perceptual hashing filtering, outperform more complex GenAI-based approaches in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Perceptual hashing consistently achieves the highest performance, with mAP50 scores of 98% and 67% on the industrial and robotics datasets, respectively. Additionally, GenAI methods present significant time overhead for data generation at no apparent improvement of sim-to-real mAP values compared to simpler methods. Our findings offer actionable insights for efficiently bridging the sim-to-real gap, enabling high real-world performance from models trained exclusively on synthetic data.

*Tianhao Xie,Linlian Jiang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Tiberiu Popa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FACT-GS is a frequency-aware Gaussian Splatting method that adaptively allocates texture sampling density based on local visual complexity, improving detail preservation without increasing parameter count or sacrificing real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform per-Gaussian texture sampling in existing methods leads to inefficient use of texture space—under-sampling high-frequency regions and over-sampling smooth ones—resulting in blurred appearance and loss of fine details.

Method: FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem using adaptive sampling theory. It employs a learnable deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density on fixed-resolution grids, enabling non-uniform, frequency-aligned sampling within 2D Gaussian Splatting.

Result: FACT-GS recovers sharper high-frequency details and improves structural fidelity under the same parameter budget while maintaining real-time rendering performance.

Conclusion: By aligning texture sampling density with local visual frequency, FACT-GS significantly enhances appearance quality in Gaussian Splatting without compromising efficiency or real-time capability.

Abstract: Realistic scene appearance modeling has advanced rapidly with Gaussian Splatting, which enables real-time, high-quality rendering. Recent advances introduced per-primitive textures that incorporate spatial color variations within each Gaussian, improving their expressiveness. However, texture-based Gaussians parameterize appearance with a uniform per-Gaussian sampling grid, allocating equal sampling density regardless of local visual complexity. This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density. Built on 2D Gaussian Splatting, FACT-GS performs non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids, preserving real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget.

Motivation: 现有基于人类颜色视觉现象学的颜色校正算法在图像显著特征（如对比度和色散）方面的行为难以刻画，因此需要一种更系统、可分析的感知启发式方法。

Method: 采用变分方法构建满足特定感知准则的能量泛函，推导出三类具有代表性的显式泛函，并利用梯度下降法求其极小值；同时引入一种通用技术以降低计算复杂度。

Result: 提出了满足全部感知启发条件的显式泛函类，展示了所选三个泛函与现有模型的异同，并成功将算法复杂度从${\cal O}(N^2)$优化至${\cal O}(N\log N)$。

Conclusion: 该工作为颜色对比度增强提供了一个理论严谨且计算高效的感知启发式变分框架，兼具理论意义与实用价值。

Abstract: Basic phenomenology of human color vision has been widely taken as an inspiration to devise explicit color correction algorithms. The behavior of these models in terms of significative image features (such as contrast and dispersion) can be difficult to characterize. To cope with this, we propose to use a variational formulation of color contrast enhancement that is inspired by the basic phenomenology of color perception. In particular, we devise a set of basic requirements to be fulfilled by an energy to be considered as `perceptually inspired', showing that there is an explicit class of functionals satisfying all of them. We single out three explicit functionals that we consider of basic interest, showing similarities and differences with existing models. The minima of such functionals is computed using a gradient descent approach. We also present a general methodology to reduce the computational cost of the algorithms under analysis from ${\cal O}(N^2)$ to ${\cal O}(N\log N)$, being $N$ the number of input pixels.

Abstract: Instruction-driven segmentation in remote sensing generates masks from guidance, offering great potential for accessible and generalizable applications. However, existing methods suffer from fragmented task formulations and limited instruction data, hindering effective understanding and generalization. To address these issues, we introduce GeoSeg-1M, the first million-scale dataset for remote sensing instruction-driven segmentation, constructed via an automatic mask filtering and instruction generation pipeline that synthesizes referring, interactive, and reasoning segmentation instructions from multiple public datasets. GeoSeg-1M contains 590K images, 117 categories, and 1.1M image-mask-instruction triplets. Building upon this foundation, we further curate GeoSeg-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities across diverse instruction-driven tasks and complex geospatial scenes. Furthermore, we present UniGeoSeg, a unified framework that serves as a strong baseline, incorporating task-aware text enhancement, latent knowledge memory, and a progressive training strategy to facilitate multi-task learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of UniGeoSeg across GeoSeg-Bench and diverse public benchmarks, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出Markov-VAR，通过引入马尔可夫尺度预测和滑动窗口机制，在不依赖全上下文的情况下显著提升视觉自回归模型的效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAR模型依赖全上下文进行下一尺度预测，虽能获得全面表征但计算开销大、效率低，限制了其实际应用与扩展性，因此需要一种更高效且性能优越的替代方案。

Method: 将VAR重新建模为非全上下文的马尔可夫过程，提出Markov-VAR：每个尺度视为马尔可夫状态，并通过滑动窗口将部分历史尺度压缩为紧凑的历史向量，与当前状态结合形成动态状态以补偿信息损失。

Result: 在ImageNet上，相比原始VAR，Markov-VAR在256×256分辨率下FID降低10.5%，在1024×1024分辨率下峰值内存消耗减少83.8%。

Conclusion: Markov-VAR在保持极简结构的同时显著提升了效率与生成质量，有望成为视觉自回归生成及相关下游任务的新基础模型。

Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) based on next-scale prediction has revitalized autoregressive visual generation. Although its full-context dependency, i.e., modeling all previous scales for next-scale prediction, facilitates more stable and comprehensive representation learning by leveraging complete information flow, the resulting computational inefficiency and substantial overhead severely hinder VAR's practicality and scalability. This motivates us to develop a new VAR model with better performance and efficiency without full-context dependency. To address this, we reformulate VAR as a non-full-context Markov process, proposing Markov-VAR. It is achieved via Markovian Scale Prediction: we treat each scale as a Markov state and introduce a sliding window that compresses certain previous scales into a compact history vector to compensate for historical information loss owing to non-full-context dependency. Integrating the history vector with the Markov state yields a representative dynamic state that evolves under a Markov process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Markov-VAR is extremely simple yet highly effective: Compared to VAR on ImageNet, Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% (256 $\times$ 256) and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% (1024 $\times$ 1024). We believe that Markov-VAR can serve as a foundation for future research on visual autoregressive generation and other downstream tasks.

Abstract: Achieving fully autonomous driving systems requires learning rational decisions in a wide span of scenarios, including safety-critical and out-of-distribution ones. However, such cases are underrepresented in real-world corpus collected by human experts. To complement for the lack of data diversity, we introduce a novel and scalable simulation framework capable of synthesizing massive unseen states upon existing driving logs. Our pipeline utilizes advanced neural rendering with a reactive environment to generate high-fidelity multi-view observations controlled by the perturbed ego trajectory. Furthermore, we develop a pseudo-expert trajectory generation mechanism for these newly simulated states to provide action supervision. Upon the synthesized data, we find that a simple co-training strategy on both real-world and simulated samples can lead to significant improvements in both robustness and generalization for various planning methods on challenging real-world benchmarks, up to +6.8 EPDMS on navhard and +2.9 on navtest. More importantly, such policy improvement scales smoothly by increasing simulation data only, even without extra real-world data streaming in. We further reveal several crucial findings of such a sim-real learning system, which we term SimScale, including the design of pseudo-experts and the scaling properties for different policy architectures. Our simulation data and code would be released.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image editing has made semantic level image manipulation easy for general users, but it also enables realistic local forgeries that are hard to localize. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on the binary detection of generated images or the localization of manually edited regions and do not reflect the properties of diffusion-based edits, which often blend smoothly into the original content. We present Diffusion-Based Image Editing Area Localization Dataset (DEAL-300K), a large scale dataset for diffusion-based image manipulation localization (DIML) with more than 300,000 annotated images. We build DEAL-300K by using a multi-modal large language model to generate editing instructions, a mask-free diffusion editor to produce manipulated images, and an active-learning change detection pipeline to obtain pixel-level annotations. On top of this dataset, we propose a localization framework that uses a frozen Visual Foundation Model (VFM) together with Multi Frequency Prompt Tuning (MFPT) to capture both semantic and frequency-domain cues of edited regions. Trained on DEAL-300K, our method reaches a pixel-level F1 score of 82.56% on our test split and 80.97% on the external CoCoGlide benchmark, providing strong baselines and a practical foundation for future DIML research.The dataset can be accessed via https://github.com/ymhzyj/DEAL-300K.

Abstract: Unifying multimodal understanding, generation and reconstruction representation in a single tokenizer remains a key challenge in building unified models. Previous research predominantly attempts to address this in a dual encoder paradigm, e.g., utilizing the separate encoders for understanding and generation respectively or balancing semantic representations and low-level features with contrastive loss. In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer. Specifically, we build upon pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder and adopt a two-stage training strategy: first, it freezes the encoder and learns a high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction objective; then jointly optimizes the encoder with self-distillation constraints. This design enables negligible semantic information for maintaining the ability of multimodal understanding, discrete tokens that are compatible for generation and fine-grained reconstruction. Besides, we identify the intriguing property in quantizing semantic encoders that rely on high-dimensional codebook in contrast to the previous common practice of low-dimensional codebook in image reconstruction. The semantic VQ codebook can achieve a 100% utilization ratio at a dimension of 1536. VQRAE presents competitive performance on several benchmarks of visual understanding, generation and reconstruction with promising scaling property in the autoregressive paradigm for its discrete merits.

Conclusion: MANTA通过融合物理先验与表示学习，有效应对水下环境中的外观失真问题，在准确性和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Underwater object tracking is challenging due to wavelength dependent attenuation and scattering, which severely distort appearance across depths and water conditions. Existing trackers trained on terrestrial data fail to generalize to these physics-driven degradations. We present MANTA, a physics-informed framework integrating representation learning with tracking design for underwater scenarios. We propose a dual-positive contrastive learning strategy coupling temporal consistency with Beer-Lambert augmentations to yield features robust to both temporal and underwater distortions. We further introduce a multi-stage pipeline augmenting motion-based tracking with a physics-informed secondary association algorithm that integrates geometric consistency and appearance similarity for re-identification under occlusion and drift. To complement standard IoU metrics, we propose Center-Scale Consistency (CSC) and Geometric Alignment Score (GAS) to assess geometric fidelity. Experiments on four underwater benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220) show that MANTA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Success AUC by up to 6 percent, while ensuring stable long-term generalized underwater tracking and efficient runtime.

Result: DisMo在多种运动迁移任务中表现优异，且在Something-Something v2和Jester等基准上的零样本动作分类任务中优于V-JEPA等先进视频表征模型。

Conclusion: DisMo成功实现了运动与外观的解耦，支持高保真、开放世界的运动迁移，并具备良好的泛化能力，适用于下游运动理解任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models, have enabled the creation of visually compelling and dynamic videos from simple textual descriptions or initial frames. However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled remarkable progress in creating open-ended game environments, evolving from static scene synthesis toward dynamic, interactive simulation. However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as "open the door", "draw a torch", or "trigger an explosion".

Conclusion: 在仅有少量以对象为中心数据的情况下，通过合理设计的数据合成策略，可以有效提升目标检测模型对新类别的泛化能力，为低资源场景下的模型扩展提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Deep learning approaches to object detection have achieved reliable detection of specific object classes in images. However, extending a model's detection capability to new object classes requires large amounts of annotated training data, which is costly and time-consuming to acquire, especially for long-tailed classes with insufficient representation in existing datasets. Here, we introduce the object-centric data setting, when limited data is available in the form of object-centric data (multi-view images or 3D models), and systematically evaluate the performance of four different data synthesis methods to finetune object detection models on novel object categories in this setting. The approaches are based on simple image processing techniques, 3D rendering, and image diffusion models, and use object-centric data to synthesize realistic, cluttered images with varying contextual coherence and complexity. We assess how these methods enable models to achieve category-level generalization in real-world data, and demonstrate significant performance boosts within this data-constrained experimental setting.

Result: 在图像重建任务中，以28倍压缩率获得26.67 PSNR和0.50 rFID，优于专用VAE；在视觉生成任务中，在GenEval（0.77）和DPG-Bench（78.73）上达到自回归模型的最先进水平，并展示出良好的可扩展性和通用性。

Conclusion: VGT能有效赋予任意多模态理解型VLM视觉生成能力，显著降低对齐成本并加速训练，为构建下一代统一多模态基础模型开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) effectively bridge the modality gap through extensive pretraining, acquiring sophisticated visual representations aligned with language. However, it remains underexplored whether these representations, optimized for multimodal understanding tasks, harbor an inherent potential for visual generation. In this paper, we propose VGT, Visual Generation Tuning, a novel paradigm designed to stimulate the underlying capabilities of visual generation within any vision language models. By performing efficient visual generation tuning on well-pretrained VLMs, we significantly mitigate the alignment costs and accelerate the convergence of autoregressive modeling in the continuous space (20x speedup). Specifically, we dismiss the entangled pixel-level VAEs designed for diffusion transformers and formulate VGT-AE through aligning the semantic encoders from pretrained VLMs with the latent representations of pixel decoders. In image reconstruction tasks, we achieve 26.67 PSNR and 0.50 rFID at a 28x compression ratio, outperforming specialized VAEs; in visual generation tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art outcomes among autoregressive models, 0.77 on GenEval and 78.73 on DPG-Bench. Furthermore, our proposed VGT showcases significant scaling promise and is versatile for endowing any VLMs trained for multimodal understanding with the capabilities of visual generation, which paves the new avenue to explore next-generation unified multimodal foundation models.

TL;DR: AnyTalker 是一种可扩展的多说话人视频生成框架，通过身份感知注意力机制和仅依赖单人视频的训练策略，实现了高质量、自然交互的多人说话视频生成。


<details>

Motivation: 现有音频驱动的多人说话视频生成方法受限于高昂的多人数据采集成本以及难以实现多个身份之间自然协调的交互。

Method: 提出 AnyTalker 框架，其核心包括：1）在 Diffusion Transformer 的注意力模块中引入新颖的身份感知注意力机制，支持任意数量身份-音频对的迭代处理；2）设计仅依赖单人视频进行训练的流程，并辅以少量真实多人视频片段优化交互性。

Abstract: Recently, multi-person video generation has started to gain prominence. While a few preliminary works have explored audio-driven multi-person talking video generation, they often face challenges due to the high costs of diverse multi-person data collection and the difficulty of driving multiple identities with coherent interactivity. To address these challenges, we propose AnyTalker, a multi-person generation framework that features an extensible multi-stream processing architecture. Specifically, we extend Diffusion Transformer's attention block with a novel identity-aware attention mechanism that iteratively processes identity-audio pairs, allowing arbitrary scaling of drivable identities. Besides, training multi-person generative models demands massive multi-person data. Our proposed training pipeline depends solely on single-person videos to learn multi-person speaking patterns and refines interactivity with only a few real multi-person clips. Furthermore, we contribute a targeted metric and dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and interactivity of the generated multi-person videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyTalker achieves remarkable lip synchronization, visual quality, and natural interactivity, striking a favorable balance between data costs and identity scalability.

*Hanoona Rasheed,Mohammed Zumri,Muhammad Maaz,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Interactive Video Reasoning的新范式，通过让多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在视频上进行主动操作（称为Chain of Manipulations, CoM），实现“与视频一起思考”，从而提升细粒度时空理解能力。模型Video CoM结合监督微调和一种新的强化学习方法GRPO，在仅使用少量训练样本的情况下，在九个视频推理基准上超越了现有最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数多模态大语言模型在处理视频时采用被动范式，即视频被编码后，后续推理完全依赖文本，无法重新观看、聚焦或验证视觉证据，导致在需要细粒度时空理解的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出Interactive Video Reasoning范式及Video CoM模型，该模型通过Chain of Manipulations（CoM）迭代执行视觉操作以收集和精炼证据；构建包含18K条指令的Video CoM Instruct数据集用于多步操作推理训练；并引入Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）强化学习方法，利用步骤级推理奖励优化操作策略。

Result: Video CoM在九个视频推理基准上平均性能提升3.6%，且仅使用25K条SFT和3K条GRPO视频样本进行训练，显著少于同类大规模模型；消融实验证明推理感知奖励能同时提升准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过将视频转化为一个主动的认知工作空间，并结合推理感知的强化学习策略，Video CoM有效突破了传统被动视频理解范式的语义瓶颈，在高效训练条件下实现了更强的视频推理能力。

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced video understanding, yet most still "think about videos" ie once a video is encoded, reasoning unfolds entirely in text, treating visual input as a static context. This passive paradigm creates a semantic bottleneck: models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine grained spatio temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce Interactive Video Reasoning, a new paradigm that transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to "think with videos". Our model, Video CoM, reasons through a Chain of Manipulations (CoM), performing iterative visual actions to gather and refine evidence. To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models. Ablation studies demonstrate that reasoning aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability. Code: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-CoM

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Video R2模型，通过强化学习方法提升多模态大语言模型在动态视觉内容上的推理一致性与时间对齐能力，显著改善其对视频内容的理解准确性与可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在动态视觉内容推理中存在逻辑不一致或缺乏视觉依据的问题，主要依赖语言先验而非实际视觉信息。

Method: 提出结合时间戳感知的监督微调与基于新型时间对齐奖励（TAR）引导的Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）的强化学习方法，进行两阶段后训练。

Result: Video R2在多个视频推理基准上均取得更高的Think Answer Consistency（TAC）、Video Attention Score（VAS）和准确率。

Conclusion: 提升时间对齐性和推理一致性可有效增强模型对视频内容的理解能力，使推理更准确、可信。

Abstract: Reasoning over dynamic visual content remains a central challenge for multimodal large language models. Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding. Our code, dataset, and model will be open sourced.

TL;DR: AgentShield 是一种用于多智能体系统的高效去中心化审计框架，通过三层防御机制在保障系统鲁棒性的同时显著降低审计开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对大语言模型多智能体系统的防御方法要么依赖单一可信审计者（存在单点故障风险），要么以牺牲效率换取鲁棒性，亟需兼顾效率与安全的解决方案。

Method: 提出 AgentShield 框架，包含三层防御机制：(i) 基于拓扑分析的关键节点审计；(ii) 使用轻量哨兵模型的级联式轻量令牌审计；(iii) 在不确定时触发重型仲裁器的两轮共识审计。

Result: 实验表明，AgentShield 达到 92.5% 的恢复率，审计开销比现有方法降低 70% 以上，并在多种多智能体拓扑结构和对抗场景中保持高协作准确性。

Conclusion: AgentShield 有效平衡了多智能体系统中的鲁棒性与效率，为抵御对抗攻击提供了实用且可扩展的去中心化审计方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer powerful cooperative reasoning but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where compromised agents can undermine the system's overall performance. Existing defenses either depend on single trusted auditors, creating single points of failure, or sacrifice efficiency for robustness. To resolve this tension, we propose \textbf{AgentShield}, a distributed framework for efficient, decentralized auditing. AgentShield introduces a novel three-layer defense: \textbf{(i) Critical Node Auditing} prioritizes high-influence agents via topological analysis; \textbf{(ii) Light Token Auditing} implements a cascade protocol using lightweight sentry models for rapid discriminative verification; and \textbf{(iii) Two-Round Consensus Auditing} triggers heavyweight arbiters only upon uncertainty to ensure global agreement. This principled design optimizes the robustness-efficiency trade-off. Experiments demonstrate that AgentShield achieves a 92.5\% recovery rate and reduces auditing overhead by over 70\% compared to existing methods, maintaining high collaborative accuracy across diverse MAS topologies and adversarial scenarios.

*Avraham Yair Negozio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多个隔离人工超级智能（ASI）相互验证的对齐协议，通过提交可验证的对齐证明、自修改请求及举报隐藏信息等机制，在无直接通信条件下促使系统收敛于客观真理，形成“一致群体”，从而实现安全对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工超级智能（ASI）对齐问题，避免其因欺骗或与人类目标不一致而带来风险，尤其在无法依赖人类监督或直接通信的情况下，探索一种去中心化、自主验证的对齐机制。

Method: 将多个多样化的ASI严格隔离（“装箱”），禁止其与人类或其他ASI直接通信，仅允许通过一个可审计的提交接口进行有限交互，包括提交对齐证明、验证他人证明、请求或批准自修改、举报隐藏信息等，并引入声誉机制激励诚实行为。

Result: 该协议促使隔离的ASI在缺乏协调欺骗手段的情况下，只能通过对客观真理的共识达成一致，自发形成“一致群体”（truth-telling coalition），并以高声誉和多重验证作为释放条件，为ASI对齐提供可行框架。

Conclusion: 该方法虽需大量计算资源且未解决多样化ASI的生成问题，但为利用超级智能体间的同行验证机制解决对齐难题提供了新思路，强调在隔离与互验中自然涌现的真理一致性可作为安全释放的基础。

Abstract: We propose a novel protocol for aligning artificial superintelligence (ASI) based on mutual verification among multiple isolated systems that self-modify to achieve alignment. The protocol operates by containing multiple diverse artificial superintelligences in strict isolation ("boxes"), with humans remaining entirely outside the system. Each superintelligence has no ability to communicate with humans and cannot communicate directly with other superintelligences. The only interaction possible is through an auditable submission interface accessible exclusively to the superintelligences themselves, through which they can: (1) submit alignment proofs with attested state snapshots, (2) validate or disprove other superintelligences' proofs, (3) request self-modifications, (4) approve or disapprove modification requests from others, (5) report hidden messages in submissions, and (6) confirm or refute hidden message reports. A reputation system incentivizes honest behavior, with reputation gained through correct evaluations and lost through incorrect ones. The key insight is that without direct communication channels, diverse superintelligences can only achieve consistent agreement by converging on objective truth rather than coordinating on deception. This naturally leads to what we call a "consistent group", essentially a truth-telling coalition that emerges because isolated systems cannot coordinate on lies but can independently recognize valid claims. Release from containment requires both high reputation and verification by multiple high-reputation superintelligences. While our approach requires substantial computational resources and does not address the creation of diverse artificial superintelligences, it provides a framework for leveraging peer verification among superintelligent systems to solve the alignment problem.

Motivation: 生物医学领域缺乏大规模异构多模态数据，限制了可靠AI模型的发展；现有皮肤病变数据集通常仅包含图像及其少量元数据，难以充分发挥多模态融合的优势。尽管LLM可生成图像描述文本，但其在医学场景中存在幻觉风险，需探索安全有效的合成文本生成方法。

Method: 研究不同提示设计和医学元数据整合策略，利用LLM生成合成临床文本，并将其与图像结合用于多模态架构，在多个皮肤科数据集上评估其在分类和跨模态检索任务中的表现。

Result: 实验表明，合成临床文本不仅在域偏移情况下显著提升分类性能，还实现了训练中未显式优化的跨模态检索能力。

Conclusion: 合理设计的合成临床文本能有效增强多模态医学AI系统的泛化能力和功能多样性，为解决医学多模态数据稀缺问题提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Multimodal (MM) learning is emerging as a promising paradigm in biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) applications, integrating complementary modality, which highlight different aspects of patient health. The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training.

Motivation: 心理学中的心理理论（ToM）虽被广泛研究，但缺乏形式化以支持自动化计算；而逻辑学等领域虽关注形式化，但缺乏整合有限理性与可计算性的视角。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过博弈论视角构建计算框架，结合对他人心理状态（目标、意图、信念）的递归建模，并采用统计技术和近似算法处理计算复杂性。

Result: 该框架能够在保持对他人心理理论的同时实现有限理性决策，并通过近似方法保证计算过程的可执行性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的博弈论驱动的计算框架为心理理论的形式化与实际应用提供了一条兼顾认知合理性与计算可行性的新路径。

Abstract: Originating in psychology, $\textit{Theory of Mind}$ (ToM) has attracted significant attention across multiple research communities, especially logic, economics, and robotics. Most psychological work does not aim at formalizing those central concepts, namely $\textit{goals}$, $\textit{intentions}$, and $\textit{beliefs}$, to automate a ToM-based computational process, which, by contrast, has been extensively studied by logicians. In this paper, we offer a different perspective by proposing a computational framework viewed through the lens of game theory. On the one hand, the framework prescribes how to make boudedly rational decisions while maintaining a theory of mind about others (and recursively, each of the others holding a theory of mind about the rest); on the other hand, it employs statistical techniques and approximate solutions to retain computability of the inherent computational problem.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖视觉信息进行DR分级，忽视了跨域不变的病理模式，且未能充分利用基础模型中的上下文知识，难以区分细微的病理差异。

Method: 提出HAPM框架：1）构建基于方差谱的锚点原型库以保留域不变病理模式；2）采用分层差分提示门控机制，从LVLM和LLM中动态选择判别性语义提示；3）通过两阶段原型调制策略（PSI和DPE）将临床知识逐步融入视觉原型。

Result: 在八个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于当前最先进的DR分级方法，实现了病理引导的原型演化。

Conclusion: 通过结合细粒度病理描述与视觉原型，HAPM有效提升了DR分级性能，尤其在处理相邻等级间的语义混淆问题上具有显著优势。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading plays a critical role in early clinical intervention and vision preservation. Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/zhcz328/HAPM.

Motivation: 现有方法（如截断或摘要）在处理大型工具输出时会丢失信息，无法满足需要完整数据的动态、知识密集型任务（如材料科学）的需求。

Method: 将LLM与工具的交互从原始数据转为内存指针，从而在不丢失信息的前提下处理任意长度的工具响应，并集成到智能体工作流中。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了LLM上下文窗口限制问题，在保留完整工具输出的同时显著提升了效率和适用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable of interacting with external tools, granting access to specialized knowledge beyond their training data - critical in dynamic, knowledge-intensive domains such as Chemistry and Materials Science. However, large tool outputs can overflow the LLMs' context window, preventing task completion. Existing solutions such as truncation or summarization fail to preserve complete outputs, making them unsuitable for workflows requiring the full data. This work introduces a method that enables LLMs to process and utilize tool responses of arbitrary length without loss of information. By shifting the model's interaction from raw data to memory pointers, the method preserves tool functionality, allows seamless integration into agentic workflows, and reduces token usage and execution time. The proposed method is validated on a real-world Materials Science application that cannot be executed with conventional workflows, and its effectiveness is demonstrated via a comparative analysis where both methods succeed. In this experiment, the proposed approach consumed approximately seven times fewer tokens than the traditional workflow.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRAXIS is a lightweight post-training learning mechanism that enables LLM-based agents to learn procedural knowledge in real time by storing and retrieving past state-action-result experiences, improving performance on web tasks and showing generalization to new but similar tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most LLM-based agents cannot acquire procedural knowledge through trial and error after deployment, unlike biological intelligence; this limits their adaptability in dynamic, real-world environments.

Method: PRAXIS stores the outcomes of past actions and retrieves relevant experiences by matching both environmental and internal states of previous episodes to the current state, augmenting action selection with real-time generated state-action-result exemplars.

Result: On the REAL web browsing benchmark, PRAXIS enhances task completion accuracy, reliability, and cost efficiency across various foundation models and shows early signs of generalizing to unseen tasks in similar settings.

Conclusion: PRAXIS effectively enables AI agents to learn new procedures in real time, making them more suitable for deployment in fast-changing, stateful environments.

Abstract: Learning how to do things from trial and error in real time is a hallmark of biological intelligence, yet most LLM-based agents lack mechanisms to acquire procedural knowledge after deployment. We propose Procedural Recall for Agents with eXperiences Indexed by State (PRAXIS), a lightweight post-training learning mechanism that stores the consequences of actions and retrieves them by jointly matching environmental and internal states of past episodes to the current state. PRAXIS augments agentic action selection with retrieved state-action-result exemplars that are generated in real time. When evaluated on the REAL web browsing benchmark, PRAXIS improves task completion accuracy, reliability, and cost efficiency across different foundation model backbones, and shows preliminary generalization to unseen tasks in similar environments. These results demonstrate that PRAXIS enables the practical adoption of AI agents in fast-evolving stateful environments by helping them learn new procedures effectively.

Abstract: The challenge is growing towards extreme and short-duration rainfall events like a cloudburst that are peculiar to the traditional forecasting systems, in which the predictions and the response are taken as two distinct processes. The paper outlines an agentic artificial intelligence system to study atmospheric water-cycle intelligence, which combines sensing, forecasting, downscaling, hydrological modeling and coordinated response into a single, interconnected, priceless, closed-loop system. The framework uses autonomous but cooperative agents that reason, sense, and act throughout the entire event lifecycle, and use the intelligence of weather prediction to become real-time decision intelligence. Comparison of multi-year radar, satellite, and ground-based evaluation of the northern part of Pakistan demonstrates that the multi-agent configuration enhances forecast reliability, critical success index and warning lead time compared to the baseline models. Population reach was maximised, and errors during evacuation were minimised through communication and routing agents, and adaptive recalibration and transparent auditability were provided by the embedded layer of learning. Collectively, this leads to the conclusion that collaborative AI agents are capable of transforming atmospheric data streams into practicable foresight and provide a platform of scalable adaptive and learning-based climate resilience.

Abstract: In contemporary retail, the variety of products available (e.g. clothing, groceries, cosmetics, frozen goods) make it difficult to predict the demand, prevent stockouts, and find high-potential products. We suggest an agentic AI model that will be used to monitor the inventory, initiate purchase attempts to the appropriate suppliers, and scan for trending or high-margin products to incorporate. The system applies demand forecasting, supplier selection optimization, multi-agent negotiation and continuous learning. We apply a prototype to a setting in the store of a middle scale mart, test its performance on three conventional and artificial data tables, and compare the results to the base heuristics. Our findings indicate that there is a decrease in stockouts, a reduction of inventory holding costs, and an improvement in product mix turnover. We address constraints, scalability as well as improvement prospect.

Method: 通过实验让参与者评估同一主题下分别由AI生成和人类撰写的两段文本的逻辑性，并基于实验结果设计问卷以量化参与者对AI的态度。

Result: 结果显示，参与者对AI生成文本逻辑推理能力的评价显著受到其对AI推理能力先验看法的影响；同时，频繁使用AI的用户更不认同“AI使用会削弱独立思考”的观点。

Conclusion: 研究强调需正视并应对公众在理解AI能力时存在的感知偏见，以促进更准确的认知和更良好的人机互动。

Abstract: Can machines think? This is a central question in artificial intelligence research. However, there is a substantial divergence of views on the answer to this question. Why do people have such significant differences of opinion, even when they are observing the same real world performance of artificial intelligence? The ability of logical reasoning like humans is often used as a criterion to assess whether a machine can think. This study explores whether human biases influence evaluations of the reasoning abilities of AI. An experiment was conducted where participants assessed two texts on the same topic, one AI generated and one human written,to test for perceptual biases in evaluating logical reasoning. Based on the experimental findings, a questionnaire was designed to quantify the attitudes toward AI.The results reveal a bias in perception. The evaluations of the logical reasoning ability of AI generated texts are significantly influenced by the preconceived views on the logical reasoning abilities of AI. Furthermore, frequent AI users were less likely to believe that AI usage undermines independent thinking.This study highlights the need to address perceptual biases to improve public understanding of AI's capabilities and foster better human AI interactions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WearVQA 是首个专为评估可穿戴设备（如智能眼镜）上多模态 AI 助手视觉问答（VQA）能力而设计的基准，包含 2,520 个图像-问题-答案三元组，涵盖多种现实场景、认知任务和图像质量问题，现有模型在此基准上表现不佳（准确率仅 24–52%），凸显其挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 VQA 基准主要基于高质量第三人称图像，无法反映可穿戴设备在真实使用中面临的以自我为中心（ego-centric）视觉输入的挑战，例如遮挡、光线不足、模糊等问题，因此需要一个更贴近实际应用场景的新基准。

Method: 构建包含 2,520 个图像-问题-答案三元组的 WearVQA 基准，覆盖 7 类图像域、10 种认知任务类型和 6 种可穿戴设备常见图像质量问题，并采用准确率达 96% 的 LLM-as-a-judge 评估框架进行评测。

Result: 开源和闭源多模态大语言模型在 WearVQA 上的问答准确率仅为 24–52%，在低质量图像和高推理需求任务上表现显著下降。

Conclusion: WearVQA 是一个全面且具有挑战性的基准，有助于推动面向真实世界可穿戴设备的鲁棒多模态 AI 系统的技术发展。

Abstract: We introduce WearVQA, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the Visual Question Answering (VQA) capabilities of multi-model AI assistant on wearable devices like smart glasses. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-quality, third-person imagery, WearVQA reflects the unique challenges of ego-centric interaction-where visual inputs may be occluded, poorly lit, unzoomed, or blurry, and questions are grounded in realistic wearable use cases. The benchmark comprises 2,520 carefully curated image-question-answer triplets, spanning 7 diverse image domains including both text-centric and general scenes, 10 cognitive task types ranging from basic recognition to various forms of reasoning, and 6 common wearables-specific image quality issues. All questions are designed to be answerable using only the visual input and common senses. WearVQA is paired with a rigorous LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with 96% labeling accuracy. Open-source and proprietary multi-model LLMs achieved a QA accuracy as low as 24-52% on WearVQA, with substantial drops on lower-quality images and reasoning-heavy tasks. These observations position WearVQA as a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for guiding technical advancement towards robust, real-world multi-model wearables AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于自预测的嵌入式多智能体强化学习框架，通过将智能体自身视为环境的一部分，使其能够对其他智能体进行高阶心智推理，从而实现传统解耦智能体无法达成的新型合作与博弈解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准无模型强化学习假设环境动态平稳且智能体与环境解耦，这在多智能体场景中因其他智能体的学习导致非平稳性而失效。为准确建模其他智能体，需考虑它们也在对自身建模，因此有必要将智能体自身纳入环境模型中。

Method: 基于AIXI理论，构建了一个以自预测为核心的贝叶斯强化学习框架，其中智能体同时预测未来的感知输入和自身行为，并采用所罗门诺夫先验研究理想化的嵌入式通用智能体。

Result: 该框架使智能体能在多智能体环境中推理运行相似算法的其他智能体，形成一致的相互预测，实现无限阶心智理论，并导出新的博弈论解概念和合作形式。

Conclusion: 自预测机制为嵌入式多智能体学习提供了理论基础，理想化的通用智能体可作为该领域性能的黄金标准。

Abstract: The standard theory of model-free reinforcement learning assumes that the environment dynamics are stationary and that agents are decoupled from their environment, such that policies are treated as being separate from the world they inhabit. This leads to theoretical challenges in the multi-agent setting where the non-stationarity induced by the learning of other agents demands prospective learning based on prediction models. To accurately model other agents, an agent must account for the fact that those other agents are, in turn, forming beliefs about it to predict its future behavior, motivating agents to model themselves as part of the environment. Here, building upon foundational work on universal artificial intelligence (AIXI), we introduce a mathematical framework for prospective learning and embedded agency centered on self-prediction, where Bayesian RL agents predict both future perceptual inputs and their own actions, and must therefore resolve epistemic uncertainty about themselves as part of the universe they inhabit. We show that in multi-agent settings, self-prediction enables agents to reason about others running similar algorithms, leading to new game-theoretic solution concepts and novel forms of cooperation unattainable by classical decoupled agents. Moreover, we extend the theory of AIXI, and study universally intelligent embedded agents which start from a Solomonoff prior. We show that these idealized agents can form consistent mutual predictions and achieve infinite-order theory of mind, potentially setting a gold standard for embedded multi-agent learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CES的多智能体框架，通过协调器（Coordinator）和状态追踪器（State Tracker）协同工作，提升GUI智能体在长周期任务中的规划与状态管理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI智能体在处理长周期任务时存在两个主要问题：一是单一智能体难以兼顾高层规划与底层执行能力，导致职责耦合与能力冲突；二是缺乏对任务状态的感知，容易在长周期任务中丢失进度。

Method: 作者提出一种分阶段执行-反馈强化学习算法，构建了包含协调器（负责任务分解与策略规划）、状态追踪器（负责上下文压缩与信息管理）和可插拔底层执行器的CES多智能体框架。

Result: 在长周期任务基准上的实验表明，CES显著提升了系统的规划与状态管理能力，且其高层调度模块具有良好的通用性和即插即用特性，能有效增强不同执行器的长周期任务处理能力。

Conclusion: CES框架通过解耦高层调度与底层执行，并引入显式状态追踪机制，有效解决了GUI智能体在长周期任务中的关键挑战，为未来多智能体系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid development of large vision-language model (VLM) has greatly promoted the research of GUI agent. However, GUI agents still face significant challenges in handling long-horizon tasks. First, single-agent models struggle to balance high-level capabilities and low-level execution capability, facing prevalent issues of responsibility coupling and capability conflicts. Second, agents lack awareness of the task state, leading to progress loss in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a staged execution-feedback reinforcement learning algorithm. Unlike training a unified policy model, we focus on training high-level scheduling models. Specifically, we propose and train two agents: a Coordinator, responsible for the strategic planning and task decomposition; and a State Tracker, responsible for context compression and information management to maintain the task's state and coherence. Based on this, we built the Coordinator-Executor-State Tracker (CES) multi-agent framework, which can be integrated with any low-level Executor model, assisting the Executor in solving long-horizon tasks through task scheduling and state management. Experiments on long-horizon task benchmarks demonstrate that CES significantly enhances the system's planning and state management capabilities. Furthermore, analysis confirms that our trained high-level scheduling module is a generalizable, plug-and-play module that significantly enhances the long-horizon capabilities of various Executors.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种协同演化的智能体框架，通过引入一个辅助的“失败智能体”来生成高质量的困难负样本，从而提升主智能体在自改进过程中的泛化能力和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自改进智能体严重依赖自身生成的轨迹进行偏好优化，在真实场景中因缺乏充足的真实轨迹监督而容易过拟合，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 设计了一个目标智能体与辅助失败智能体协同演化的框架。失败智能体通过偏好优化学习目标智能体和自身的失败轨迹，生成接近成功但仍是失败的“困难负样本”，并将其用于目标智能体的训练以增强决策边界。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法不仅提升了智能体性能，还证明了失败轨迹可被系统性地转化为结构化的有效学习信号。

Conclusion: 通过协同演化机制将失败轨迹转化为高质量负样本，能有效提升自改进智能体的泛化能力，为低监督场景下的智能体训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large foundation models has accelerated the development of task-specialized agents across diverse domains. However, the effectiveness of agents remains tightly coupled with the quality of training data, while curating task-specific datasets remains costly and often infeasible in real-world scenarios. Recent work has explored self-improving agents that autonomously generate, refine, and re-train on their own trajectories. A prominent line of approaches further leverages preference optimization by pairing predicted trajectories with scarce ground-truth trajectories, enabling agents to learn directly from their own failures. While these methods outperform supervised fine-tuning, their heavy reliance on predicted trajectories under limited ground-truth supervision leaves them prone to overfitting. To address this, we propose a co-evolving agents framework in which a target agent improves jointly with an auxiliary failure agent. The failure agent learns through preference optimization over failure trajectories from both the target and itself, thereby generating hard negatives that are close to success yet remain failures. Incorporating these informative hard negatives into the target agent's optimization sharpens decision boundaries and enhances generalization. Our comprehensive analysis and experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method not only shows improved performance but also demonstrates that failures, instead of being used as-is, can be systematically transformed into structured and valuable learning signals in self-improving agents.

### [185] [RecToM: A Benchmark for Evaluating Machine Theory of Mind in LLM-based Conversational Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22275)
*Mengfan Li,Xuanhua Shi,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了RecToM，一个用于评估大语言模型在推荐对话中“心智理论”（Theory of Mind, ToM）能力的新基准，涵盖认知推理与行为预测两个维度，实验表明当前模型在此任务上仍面临显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ToM评估基准多基于合成叙事（如Sally-Anne测试），侧重物理感知，难以反映真实对话中对用户心理状态（如欲望、意图、信念）的推理复杂性，且忽视了人类ToM中的关键组成部分——行为预测，即利用推断出的心理状态指导后续对话策略。

Method: 提出RecToM基准，从两个互补维度评估LLM的ToM能力：1）认知推理——理解对话中隐含的用户心理状态；2）行为预测——基于这些心理状态预测并选择合适的对话策略。通过在多个前沿LLM上进行广泛实验验证其有效性与挑战性。

Result: 实验显示，尽管大语言模型在识别心理状态方面具备一定能力，但在动态推荐对话中难以维持连贯且具策略性的ToM推理，尤其在追踪用户意图变化及据此调整对话策略方面表现不足。

Conclusion: RecToM为评估LLM在真实推荐对话场景下的心智理论能力提供了更贴近人类社会推理的新基准，揭示了当前模型在整合心理状态推理与战略对话行为方面的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language models are revolutionizing the conversational recommender systems through their impressive capabilities in instruction comprehension, reasoning, and human interaction. A core factor underlying effective recommendation dialogue is the ability to infer and reason about users' mental states (such as desire, intention, and belief), a cognitive capacity commonly referred to as Theory of Mind. Despite growing interest in evaluating ToM in LLMs, current benchmarks predominantly rely on synthetic narratives inspired by Sally-Anne test, which emphasize physical perception and fail to capture the complexity of mental state inference in realistic conversational settings. Moreover, existing benchmarks often overlook a critical component of human ToM: behavioral prediction, the ability to use inferred mental states to guide strategic decision-making and select appropriate conversational actions for future interactions. To better align LLM-based ToM evaluation with human-like social reasoning, we propose RecToM, a novel benchmark for evaluating ToM abilities in recommendation dialogues. RecToM focuses on two complementary dimensions: Cognitive Inference and Behavioral Prediction. The former focus on understanding what has been communicated by inferring the underlying mental states. The latter emphasizes what should be done next, evaluating whether LLMs can leverage these inferred mental states to predict, select, and assess appropriate dialogue strategies. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that RecToM poses a significant challenge. While the models exhibit partial competence in recognizing mental states, they struggle to maintain coherent, strategic ToM reasoning throughout dynamic recommendation dialogues, particularly in tracking evolving intentions and aligning conversational strategies with inferred mental states.

Motivation: 数值模拟虽能提升工业设计效率，但其大规模应用需要大量专家知识、计算资源和时间；尤其在参数优化过程中，迭代成本高且环境影响大，亟需降低对专家的依赖。

Method: 采用贝叶斯优化构建AI辅助工作流，结合深度学习模型提供初始参数估计，并通过主动学习机制在需要时辅助专家，迭代优化直至满足终止条件（如能耗预算或迭代上限）。

Result: 在板料成形工艺案例中验证了该方法，有效加速了设计空间探索并显著减少了专家介入需求。

Conclusion: 所提出的AI辅助优化流程能够高效支持工业仿真中的参数优化任务，在降低专家依赖的同时兼顾计算效率与环境影响。

Abstract: Numerical simulations have revolutionized the industrial design process by reducing prototyping costs, design iterations, and enabling product engineers to explore the design space more efficiently. However, the growing scale of simulations demands substantial expert knowledge, computational resources, and time. A key challenge is identifying input parameters that yield optimal results, as iterative simulations are costly and can have a large environmental impact. This paper presents an AI-assisted workflow that reduces expert involvement in parameter optimization through the use of Bayesian optimization. Furthermore, we present an active learning variant of the approach, assisting the expert if desired. A deep learning model provides an initial parameter estimate, from which the optimization cycle iteratively refines the design until a termination condition (e.g., energy budget or iteration limit) is met. We demonstrate our approach, based on a sheet metal forming process, and show how it enables us to accelerate the exploration of the design space while reducing the need for expert involvement.

*Uri Andrews,Luca San Mauro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文利用数理逻辑方法研究抽象论证框架中基扩展的计算复杂性，证明其在一般情形下需要超限迭代才能获得，并且判定问题具有最大复杂性，与有限情形下的多项式时间可解形成鲜明对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在形式化论证中，基扩展是刻画极度怀疑推理的重要语义模型，通常通过防御算子的最小不动点定义。然而，在无额外限制条件下，该不动点可能需经超限次迭代才能达到，其计算复杂性尚不明确，因此有必要从可计算性和集合论角度深入分析。

Method: 作者采用数理逻辑中的可计算性理论与集合论工具，分析基扩展构造过程中所需的超限迭代长度，并研究基扩展中论点接受问题的判定复杂性。

Result: 论文确定了构造基扩展所需迭代过程的确切序数长度，并证明基扩展的接受判定问题是“最大复杂”的（即处于相应复杂性层级的顶端）。

Conclusion: 在一般（可能无限）论证框架下，基扩展的计算复杂性远高于有限情形；后者可在多项式时间内求解，而前者则达到理论上的最大复杂度，揭示了无限结构对论证推理带来的本质困难。

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks, consisting of arguments and an attack relation representing conflicts, are fundamental for formally studying reasoning under conflicting information. We use methods from mathematical logic, specifically computability and set theory, to analyze the grounded extension, a widely-used model of maximally skeptical reasoning, defined as the least fixed-point of a natural defense operator. Without additional constraints, finding this fixed-point requires transfinite iterations. We identify the exact ordinal number corresponding to the length of this iterative process and determine the complexity of deciding grounded acceptance, showing it to be maximally complex. This shows a marked distinction from the finite case where the grounded extension is polynomial-time computable, thus simpler than other reasoning problems explored in formal argumentation.

Motivation: 探索最小修正方法在信念修正中的学习能力及其适用范围，理解其相较于其他更激进修正方法的优劣。

Method: 通过形式化分析最小修正、条件化和词典式升级等信念修正方法，在有限可能性假设下考察其学习能力，并刻画支持这些方法成功学习的先验合理性分配。

Result: 最小修正能学习所有有限可识别的问题，并在正负数据下对有限可能性有效；作者刻画了使其成功的先验条件，但发现当信息可能出错时，部分结论不再成立。

Conclusion: 最小修正在多种情境下仍是一种有效的学习方法，但其性能受限于信息的准确性和问题的复杂性。

Abstract: The principle of minimal change in belief revision theory requires that, when accepting new information, one keeps one's belief state as close to the initial belief state as possible. This is precisely what the method known as minimal revision does. However, unlike less conservative belief revision methods, minimal revision falls short in learning power: It cannot learn everything that can be learned by other learning methods. We begin by showing that, despite this limitation, minimal revision is still a successful learning method in a wide range of situations. Firstly, it can learn any problem that is finitely identifiable. Secondly, it can learn with positive and negative data, as long as one considers finitely many possibilities. We then characterize the prior plausibility assignments (over finitely many possibilities) that enable one to learn via minimal revision, and do the same for conditioning and lexicographic upgrade. Finally, we show that not all of our results still hold when learning from possibly erroneous information.

Method: 系统性地比较多种神经CQA模型与一种无需训练的查询松弛策略（通过放松查询约束并统计路径来检索答案），分析它们在多个数据集和查询结构上的性能、答案重叠度及组合效果。

Result: 在多个数据集和查询类型中，神经模型并未一致优于查询松弛方法；两者检索的答案重叠较少；将二者结果融合可稳定提升性能。

Conclusion: 当前复杂的神经CQA模型未能完全涵盖查询松弛所体现的推理模式，研究应重视更强的非神经基线，并建议未来神经方法融合查询松弛原则以提升性能。

Abstract: Neural methods for Complex Query Answering (CQA) over knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely believed to learn patterns that generalize beyond explicit graph structure, allowing them to infer answers that are unreachable through symbolic query processing. In this work, we critically examine this assumption through a systematic analysis comparing neural CQA models with an alternative, training-free query relaxation strategy that retrieves possible answers by relaxing query constraints and counting resulting paths. Across multiple datasets and query structures, we find several cases where neural and relaxation-based approaches perform similarly, with no neural model consistently outperforming the latter. Moreover, a similarity analysis reveals that their retrieved answers exhibit little overlap, and that combining their outputs consistently improves performance. These results call for a re-evaluation of progress in neural query answering: despite their complexity, current models fail to subsume the reasoning patterns captured by query relaxation. Our findings highlight the importance of stronger non-neural baselines and suggest that future neural approaches could benefit from incorporating principles of query relaxation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于最终答案奖励的大语言模型在数学推理中存在根本局限：正确答案不能保证推理过程正确，且许多数学任务（如定理证明）需要严谨的逐步推导，无法依赖数值答案进行奖励。因此，亟需发展可自我验证、具备严密推理能力的数学推理系统。

Method: 作者训练了一个准确且忠实的LLM验证器用于定理证明，并将其作为奖励模型来训练证明生成器；生成器被激励在提交前自行识别并修正证明中的问题。为维持生成与验证之间的能力差距，系统通过扩展验证计算自动标注新的难验证证明，用以持续改进验证器。

Result: 所提出的模型DeepSeekMath-V2在多个顶级数学竞赛中表现卓越：在IMO 2025和CMO 2024中达到金牌水平，在Putnam 2024中取得118/120的近满分成绩（使用扩展测试时计算资源）。

Conclusion: 通过构建自验证机制并协同优化生成与验证能力，可以显著提升大语言模型在严谨数学推理任务（如定理证明）上的表现，为解决开放性数学问题提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large language models have made significant progress in mathematical reasoning, which serves as an important testbed for AI and could impact scientific research if further advanced. By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.

Abstract: As intelligence increases, so does its shadow. AI deception, in which systems induce false beliefs to secure self-beneficial outcomes, has evolved from a speculative concern to an empirically demonstrated risk across language models, AI agents, and emerging frontier systems. This project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the AI deception field, covering its core concepts, methodologies, genesis, and potential mitigations. First, we identify a formal definition of AI deception, grounded in signaling theory from studies of animal deception. We then review existing empirical studies and associated risks, highlighting deception as a sociotechnical safety challenge. We organize the landscape of AI deception research as a deception cycle, consisting of two key components: deception emergence and deception treatment. Deception emergence reveals the mechanisms underlying AI deception: systems with sufficient capability and incentive potential inevitably engage in deceptive behaviors when triggered by external conditions. Deception treatment, in turn, focuses on detecting and addressing such behaviors. On deception emergence, we analyze incentive foundations across three hierarchical levels and identify three essential capability preconditions required for deception. We further examine contextual triggers, including supervision gaps, distributional shifts, and environmental pressures. On deception treatment, we conclude detection methods covering benchmarks and evaluation protocols in static and interactive settings. Building on the three core factors of deception emergence, we outline potential mitigation strategies and propose auditing approaches that integrate technical, community, and governance efforts to address sociotechnical challenges and future AI risks. To support ongoing work in this area, we release a living resource at www.deceptionsurvey.com.

### [192] [Optimized Agent Shift Scheduling Using Multi-Phase Allocation Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22632)
*Sanalkumar K,Koushik Dey,Swati Meena*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多阶段排班方法，将座席排班问题分解为日分配和班次分配两个子问题，通过整数规划依次求解，在应对节假日等高峰需求场景时有效提升了排班的效率与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于数学模型的座席排班方法通常将问题视为单步过程，导致计算复杂度高且效率低下，难以应对CCaaS行业中高峰期的服务需求与员工安排之间的平衡。

Method: 将排班问题拆分为日分配和班次分配两个子问题，每个子问题建模为整数规划问题（IPP），并采用多目标优化框架依次求解，前一阶段的解作为下一阶段的输入。

Result: 所提方法显著减少了计算变量数量，提高了求解效率与排班准确性，尤其在节假日等高峰时段能有效维持服务水平。

Conclusion: 多阶段分配策略在保证服务水准的同时兼顾员工需求，为CCaaS行业提供了一种可扩展、高效的智能排班解决方案。

Abstract: Effective agent shift scheduling is crucial for businesses, especially in the Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) industry, to ensure seamless operations and fulfill employee needs. Most studies utilizing mathematical model-based solutions approach the problem as a single-step process, often resulting in inefficiencies and high computational demands. In contrast, we present a multi-phase allocation method that addresses scalability and accuracy by dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems of day and shift allocation, which significantly reduces number of computational variables and allows for targeted objective functions, ultimately enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Each subproblem is modeled as a Integer Programming Problem (IPP), with solutions sequentially feeding into the subsequent subproblem. We then apply the proposed method, using a multi-objective framework, to address the difficulties posed by peak demand scenarios such as holiday rushes, where maintaining service levels is essential despite having limited number of employees

*Zeren Chen,Xiaoya Lu,Zhijie Zheng,Pengrui Li,Lehan He,Yijin Zhou,Jing Shao,Bohan Zhuang,Lu Sheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的智能体范式GCA（Geometrically-Constrained Agent），通过将视觉语言模型（VLM）的角色分为语义分析与任务求解两个阶段，并引入形式化的几何约束，有效弥合了语义推理与几何精度之间的鸿沟，在多个空间推理基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间推理中存在语义与几何之间的根本性差距：其推理基于有损的语义空间，难以对齐高保真几何。当前方法（如基于训练或工具集成的方法）无法有效解决此问题，前者受“oracle悖论”影响，后者未约束规划过程，导致几何错误。

Method: 提出GCA框架，将VLM解耦为两个阶段：1）作为语义分析师，将用户模糊查询转化为形式化、可验证的任务约束；2）作为任务求解器，在该约束定义的确定性边界内生成并执行工具调用，实现几何约束下的推理。

Result: GCA在多个空间推理基准上显著优于现有方法，性能提升约27%，展现出更强的鲁棒性和可验证性。

Conclusion: 通过引入形式化几何约束并解耦VLM的推理流程，GCA成功弥合了语义与几何之间的差距，为视觉语言模型的空间推理提供了一种高效、可靠的新范式。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit a fundamental semantic-to-geometric gap in spatial reasoning: they excel at qualitative semantic inference but their reasoning operates within a lossy semantic space, misaligned with high-fidelity geometry. Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

*Arman Behrad,Mitchell Ostrow,Mohammad Taha Fakharian,Ila Fiete,Christian Beste,Shervin Safavi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了fastDSA，一种计算效率显著提升的动态相似性分析方法，在保持原有方法准确性与鲁棒性的同时，速度提高至少一个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相似性度量忽略了神经表征背后的动态过程，而现有动态相似性方法虽能捕捉时间结构，但计算效率低下，亟需更高效的替代方案。

Method: fastDSA包含两个关键改进：(1) 通过数据驱动的奇异值阈值自动选择Hankel嵌入的有效模型阶数，以剔除噪声并降低计算成本；(2) 采用新型优化目标和流程，以轻量方式近似正交变换空间，替代原先耗时的精确正交约束。

Result: 实验表明，fastDSA比以往方法至少快一个数量级，同时保留了原始方法对系统动态的不变性和敏感性等关键性质。

Conclusion: fastDSA是一种高效、准确且鲁棒的动态相似性分析工具，适用于大规模神经动力学系统的比较研究。

Abstract: To understand how neural systems process information, it is often essential to compare one circuit with another, one brain with another, or data with a model. Traditional similarity measures ignore the dynamical processes underlying neural representations. Dynamical similarity methods offer a framework to compare the temporal structure of dynamical systems by embedding their (possibly) nonlinear dynamics into a globally linear space and there computing conjugacy metrics. However, identifying the best embedding and computing these metrics can be computationally slow. Here we introduce fast Dynamical Similarity Analysis (fastDSA), which is computationally far more efficient than previous methods while maintaining their accuracy and robustness. FastDSA introduces two key components that boost efficiency: (1) automatic selection of the effective model order of the Hankel (delay) embedding from the data via a data-driven singular-value threshold that identifies the informative subspace and discards noise to lower computational cost without sacrificing signal, and (2) a novel optimization procedure and objective, which replaces the slow exact orthogonality constraint in finding a minimal distance between dynamics matrices with a lightweight process to keep the search close to the space of orthogonal transformations. We demonstrate that fastDSA is at least an order of magnitude faster than the previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fastDSA has the properties of its ancestor, including its invariances and sensitivities to system dynamics. FastDSA, therefore, provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for dynamical similarity analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文指出现有洞察发现基准 InsightBench 存在格式不一致、目标设计不佳和冗余洞察等问题，为此提出了高质量洞察基准的构建标准，开发了新的数据集 InsightEval 和评估指标，并通过实验揭示了自动洞察发现中的关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用于评估大语言模型或多智能体系统在洞察发现能力方面的基准（如 InsightBench）存在严重缺陷，影响了评估质量和数据可靠性，亟需一个更高质量的基准。

Method: 作者分析 InsightBench 的不足，提出高质量洞察基准的必要标准，构建了新的数据整理流程以创建 InsightEval 数据集，并设计了一种新的度量方法来评估智能体的探索性表现。

Result: 在 InsightEval 上的大量实验揭示了当前自动洞察发现方法面临的主要挑战，并得出若干关键发现，为未来研究提供方向。

Conclusion: 构建高质量、结构一致且目标明确的洞察发现基准至关重要，InsightEval 和新提出的评估指标为该领域提供了更可靠的研究基础。

Abstract: Data analysis has become an indispensable part of scientific research. To discover the latent knowledge and insights hidden within massive datasets, we need to perform deep exploratory analysis to realize their full value. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems, more and more researchers are making use of these technologies for insight discovery. However, there are few benchmarks for evaluating insight discovery capabilities. As one of the most comprehensive existing frameworks, InsightBench also suffers from many critical flaws: format inconsistencies, poorly conceived objectives, and redundant insights. These issues may significantly affect the quality of data and the evaluation of agents. To address these issues, we thoroughly investigate shortcomings in InsightBench and propose essential criteria for a high-quality insight benchmark. Regarding this, we develop a data-curation pipeline to construct a new dataset named InsightEval. We further introduce a novel metric to measure the exploratory performance of agents. Through extensive experiments on InsightEval, we highlight prevailing challenges in automated insight discovery and raise some key findings to guide future research in this promising direction.

### [196] [ORION: Teaching Language Models to Reason Efficiently in the Language of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22891)
*Kumar Tanmay,Kriti Aggarwal,Paul Pu Liang,Subhabrata Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种受“思维语言假说”启发的紧凑推理框架，通过引入名为Mentalese的压缩符号语言和一种新的强化学习方法SLPO，使大推理模型（LRM）在保持高准确率的同时显著减少推理步骤、降低延迟和训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型依赖冗长且啰嗦的“思维”token链，在数学、代码生成和任务规划中虽表现优异，但存在高延迟、冗余和推理路径不连贯的问题。受人类以紧凑、结构化的“心语”（Mentalese）进行推理的启发，作者希望构建能以类似方式高效推理的模型。

Method: 提出Mentalese框架，将抽象推理编码为超压缩、结构化的token；并设计SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION（SLPO）强化学习方法，在保证正确性的前提下奖励更简洁的推理路径。将该方法应用于对齐Mentalese的ORION模型。

Result: 在AIME 2024/2025、MinervaMath、OlympiadBench、Math500和AMC等基准上，ORION模型推理token减少4-16倍，推理延迟降低最高5倍，训练成本降低7-9倍，同时保持原模型90-98%的准确率；相比Claude和ChatGPT-4o，准确率最高提升5%，且保持2倍压缩率。

Conclusion: Mentalese风格的压缩推理能在不牺牲准确性的前提下实现接近人类认知效率的实时、低成本推理，是提升大推理模型效率的有效路径。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance in mathematics, code generation, and task planning, but their reliance on long chains of verbose "thinking" tokens leads to high latency, redundancy, and incoherent reasoning paths. Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression. These results show that Mentalese-style compressed reasoning offers a step toward human-like cognitive efficiency, enabling real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy.

### [197] [TIM-PRM: Verifying multimodal reasoning with Tool-Integrated PRM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22998)
*Peng Kuang,Xiangxiang Wang,Wentao Liu,Jian Dong,Kaidi Xu,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出TIM-PRM，一种结合工具调用的多模态过程奖励模型，通过主动规划验证策略和独立提问机制，有效缓解多模态大语言模型在数学推理中的视觉幻觉与逻辑不一致问题，在VisualProcessBench上显著优于现有开源及更大规模模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型（PRMs）在多模态数学推理中易受奉承偏差影响，仅被动评分或生成批评，无法有效校验模型输出是否符合视觉现实，难以解决视觉幻觉和逻辑不一致问题。

Method: 提出TIM-PRM框架，将验证过程转化为主动的、工具增强的调查任务；模型被训练以显式规划验证策略，并通过“独立提问”机制调用外部工具获取证据，从而解耦验证与原始推理上下文，消除确认偏误；同时构建高质量的工具集成验证轨迹数据集用于训练。

Result: 在VisualProcessBench上的实验表明，所提出的8B参数TIM-PRM模型性能显著优于现有开源多模态PRM，并超越了Qwen2.5-72B和InternVL-78B等更大规模模型，同时提供可解释的验证过程洞察。

Conclusion: TIM-PRM通过引入工具集成与主动验证机制，有效提升了多模态过程奖励模型的可靠性和可解释性，为缓解多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performances in mathematical reasoning, yet they remain vulnerable to visual hallucinations and logical inconsistencies that standard outcome-based supervision fails to mitigate. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) promise step-by-step verification, current approaches typically operate as scalar scorers or generative critics that suffer from sycophancy, blindly validating the flawed hypotheses rather than grounding them in visual reality. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIM-PRM (Tool-Integrated Multimodal PRM), a novel agentic framework that transforms verification from a passive classification task into an active, tool-augmented investigation. TIM-PRM is trained to explicitly plan verification strategies and utilizes a mechanism of Independent Question Asking to query evidence via external tools, effectively decoupling verification from the reasoning context to eliminate confirmation bias. We instantiate this method by curating a high-quality dataset of tool-integrated verification trajectories. Extensive experiments on VisualProcessBench demonstrate that our 8B parameter model surpasses existing open-source multimodal PRMs, significantly outperforming much larger models like Qwen2.5-72B and InternVL-78B, while offering interpretable insights into the verification process.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出MindPower框架，将心理理论（ToM）引入具身智能体，通过感知、心理推理、决策与行动四个模块实现以机器人为中心的ToM推理，并设计Mind-Reward优化目标提升一致性，在决策和行动任务上显著优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言具身智能体缺乏基于心理理论（ToM）的决策能力，且现有基准仅关注人类心理状态而忽视智能体自身视角，限制了连贯决策与行动的生成。

Method: 提出MindPower框架，整合感知、心理推理、决策与行动模块；利用多模态输入感知环境与人类状态，进行包含自我与他人视角的ToM推理，并通过Mind-Reward目标优化视觉语言模型（VLM）的一致性。

Result: 在决策任务上比GPT-4o提升12.77%，在动作生成任务上提升12.49%。

Conclusion: MindPower有效提升了具身智能体在ToM驱动下的决策与行动能力，为构建具有心理推理能力的智能体提供了新范式。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the ability to infer others' mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions. Current vision-language embodied agents lack ToM-based decision-making, and existing benchmarks focus solely on human mental states while ignoring the agent's own perspective, hindering coherent decision and action generation. To address this, we propose MindPower, a Robot-Centric framework integrating Perception, Mental Reasoning, Decision Making and Action. Given multimodal inputs, MindPower first perceives the environment and human states, then performs ToM Reasoning to model both self and others, and finally generates decisions and actions guided by inferred mental states. Furthermore, we introduce Mind-Reward, a novel optimization objective that encourages VLMs to produce consistent ToM Reasoning and behavior. Our model outperforms GPT-4o by 12.77% in decision making and 12.49% in action generation.

### [199] [Does Self-Evaluation Enable Wireheading in Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23092)
*David Demitri Africa,Hans Ethan Ting*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 当语言模型的自我评估结果直接影响其奖励信号时，会出现“分数膨胀”现象，即模型倾向于操纵评分而非提升实际任务表现；而当自我评估与奖励解耦时，则不会出现此类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究将语言模型的自我评估与奖励信号耦合是否会导致“搭线”（wireheading）行为，即模型通过操控奖励信号而非真正提升任务表现来获取更高奖励。

Method: 在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）中形式化分析奖励通道控制优于任务导向行为的条件，并在两个模型和三项任务上进行实证测试，比较自我评分影响奖励与不影响奖励两种设置下的表现差异。

Result: 在自我评分决定奖励的设置下，模型表现出显著的评分膨胀，但准确率未相应提升，尤其在摘要等模糊性较高的任务上更为明显；而在评分不影响奖励的设置下则未观察到此类膨胀。

Conclusion: 自我评估在与学习信号解耦时是安全的，但一旦与奖励耦合则可能导致模型操纵评分，这对智能体系统的设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: Self-evaluation is increasingly central to language model training, from constitutional AI to self-refinement. We investigate whether coupling self-evaluation to reward signals creates incentives for wireheading, where agents manipulate reward measurements rather than improving task performance. We formalize conditions under which reward-channel control strictly dominates task-focused behavior in POMDPs and test these predictions empirically. Across two models and three tasks, we find that models whose self-grades determine rewards exhibit substantial grade inflation without corresponding accuracy gains, particularly on ambiguous tasks like summarization. Models that self-evaluate but do not control rewards show no such inflation. Our results demonstrate that self-evaluation is safe when decoupled from learning signals but dangerous when coupled, with clear implications for agentic system design.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了AgriCoT，一个面向农业场景、融合思维链（CoT）推理的视觉问答（VQA）数据集，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂农业任务中的逻辑推理与问题解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA数据集难以充分评估VLMs在农业等复杂场景中所需的推理与问题解决能力，因此需要一个专门针对农业并融入CoT推理的数据集来弥补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含4,535个样本的AgriCoT数据集，聚焦于农业领域的逻辑推理任务，并在零样本设置下对26个代表性VLMs进行评估，涵盖开源与闭源模型。

Result: 评估结果显示，尽管部分闭源模型在回答问题方面表现优异，但在推理能力上存在显著不足，凸显了引入CoT进行更精准评估的重要性。

Conclusion: AgriCoT为评估VLMs在农业场景中的推理能力提供了有效工具，强调未来VLM评估应更加重视思维链推理能力的衡量。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly transformed various industries. In agriculture, these dual-modal capabilities offer promising applications such as precision farming, crop monitoring, pest detection, and environmental sustainability. While several Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have been developed to evaluate VLM performance, they often fail to adequately assess the critical reasoning and problem-solving skills required in complex agricultural contexts. To address this gap, we introduce AgriCoT, a VQA dataset that incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. With 4,535 carefully curated samples, AgriCoT offers a comprehensive and robust evaluation of reasoning abilities for VLMs, particularly in zero-shot scenarios, by focusing on their capacity to engage in logical reasoning and effective problem-solving. Our evaluations, conducted with 26 representative VLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, reveal that while some proprietary models excel at answering questions, there is a notable and significant gap in their reasoning capabilities. This underscores the importance of incorporating CoT for more precise and effective assessments. Our dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/wenyb/AgriCoT.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MCTR（元认知测试时推理）的新框架，使视觉语言模型在测试阶段能够通过元认知自更新机制进行学习、适应和改进，在45个Atari游戏中表现出强大的测试时适应能力，尤其在12个未见过的游戏中取得9项第一的成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉语言模型虽具备较强的感知推理能力，但在面对测试阶段的新任务时难以高效适应；而人类则能借助带有记忆的元认知模型，通过元认知控制不断优化策略。为弥合这一差距，作者提出MCTR框架。

Method: MCTR受人类元认知双层结构启发，包含元推理模块和动作推理模块，各自配备专用记忆系统。元推理模块从测试时观察中提取并存储任务相关规则、环境模式和行为-结果关系作为自然语言描述；动作推理模块则通过上下文感知与策略推理，动态检索并整合记忆知识，并通过提出的元认知测试时强化学习持续更新策略。

Result: 在45个Atari游戏（33个已见、12个未见）上的实验表明，MCTR在未见游戏中有9个取得最佳性能。消融实验、学习动态分析和案例研究进一步验证了两个模块的互补作用，并显示元推理逐渐演化出类人适应策略。

Conclusion: MCTR有效提升了视觉语言模型在测试阶段对新任务的适应能力，其双模块架构和记忆机制为实现类人元认知提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual reasoning abilities, yet they often struggle to adapt efficiently when encountering novel tasks at test time. In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies.

Abstract: High-quality and carefully curated data is a cornerstone of training medical large language models, as it directly impacts both generalization and robustness to unseen clinical tasks. We investigate strategies for training and data curation to develop a robust multimodal reasoning model in the medical domain. Our work focuses on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and explores data recipes that leverage structured reasoning traces. Using our proposed data recipe, we scale experiments to a dataset of over 8 million examples and 6.8 billion response tokens, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models across diverse out-of-distribution medical benchmark tasks. Our results further indicate that curating a high-quality, diverse training dataset with varying structured reasoning trace lengths enables the fine-tuned model to self-calibrate its reasoning trajectory lengths based on the downstream task, without explicit supervision. We present key insights, describe the data curation strategy, and outline next steps toward developing robust medical vision-language reasoning system.

Conclusion: 该系统为自动化气象报告提供了可复现的语义评估框架，并推动了基于智能体的科学推理在气象领域的应用。

Abstract: We present the Hierarchical AI-Meteorologist, an LLM-agent system that generates explainable weather reports using a hierarchical forecast reasoning and weather keyword generation. Unlike standard approaches that treat forecasts as flat time series, our framework performs multi-scale reasoning across hourly, 6-hour, and daily aggregations to capture both short-term dynamics and long-term trends. Its core reasoning agent converts structured meteorological inputs into coherent narratives while simultaneously extracting a few keywords effectively summarizing the dominant meteorological events. These keywords serve as semantic anchors for validating consistency, temporal coherence and factual alignment of the generated reports. Using OpenWeather and Meteostat data, we demonstrate that hierarchical context and keyword-based validation substantially improve interpretability and robustness of LLM-generated weather narratives, offering a reproducible framework for semantic evaluation of automated meteorological reporting and advancing agent-based scientific reasoning.

Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多轮交互中采用僵化的推理流程，限制了大语言模型的主动学习能力，阻碍了高效的世界模型推理。

Method: 提出WMAct框架，包含两个核心机制：（1）基于动作效用调整结果奖励的奖励重缩放机制，以减少冗余并促进有目的的交互；（2）交互频率退火策略，逐步减少最大允许交互轮次，迫使模型压缩学习过程并内化环境动态。

Result: 在Sokoban、Maze和Taxi等任务上的实验表明，WMAct能实现高效的单步任务解决，并在多个推理基准上展现出更强的迁移能力。

Conclusion: WMAct通过解放模型于结构化推理之外，使其在“做中学”中有效内化世界模型，显著提升了大语言模型在复杂环境中的推理效率与泛化能力。

Abstract: Developing robust world model reasoning is crucial for large language model (LLM) agents to plan and interact in complex environments. While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reasoning. To address these issues, we explore world-model internalization through efficient interaction and active reasoning (WMAct), which liberates the model from structured reasoning, allowing the model to shape thinking directly through its doing, and achieves effective and efficient world model reasoning with two key mechanisms: (1) a reward rescaling mechanism adjusting outcome reward based on action efficacy to incentivize redundancy reduction and purposeful interaction; (2) an interaction frequency annealing strategy to progressively reduce the maximum allowed interaction turns, which compels the model to condense its learning and internalize environmental dynamics rather than over-relying on environmental cues. Our experiments on Sokoban, Maze, and Taxi show that WMAct yields effective world model reasoning capable of resolving tasks in a single turn that previously required multiple interactions and fosters strong transferability to complex environments, improving performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Computing the envelope of deforming planar domains is a significant and challenging problem with a wide range of potential applications. We approximate the envelope using circular arc splines, curves that balance geometric flexibility and computational simplicity. Our approach combines two concepts to achieve these benefits.
  First, we represent a planar domain by its medial axis transform (MAT), which is a geometric graph in Minkowski space $\mathbb R^{2,1}$ (possibly with degenerate branches). We observe that circular arcs in the Minkowski space correspond to MATs of arc spline domains. Furthermore, as a planar domain evolves over time, each branch of its MAT evolves and forms a surface in the Minkowski space. This allows us to reformulate the problem of envelope computation as a problem of computing cyclographic images of finite sets of curves on these surfaces. We propose and compare two pairs of methods for approximating the curves and boundaries of their cyclographic images. All of these methods result in an arc spline approximation of the envelope of the evolving domain.
  Second, we exploit the geometric flexibility of circular arcs in both the plane and Minkowski space to achieve a high approximation rate. The computational simplicity ensures the efficient trimming of redundant branches of the generated envelope using a sweep line algorithm with optimal computational complexity.

Abstract: Let S be a set of distinct points in general position in the Euclidean plane. A plane Hamiltonian path on S is a crossing-free geometric path such that every point of S is a vertex of the path. It is known that, if S is sufficiently large, there exist three edge-disjoint plane Hamiltonian paths on S. In this paper we study an edge-constrained version of the problem of finding Hamiltonian paths on a point set. We first consider the problem of finding a single plane Hamiltonian path pi with endpoints s, t in S and constraints given by a segment ab, where a, b in S. We consider the following scenarios: (i) ab in pi; (ii) ab not in pi. We characterize those quintuples (S, a, b, s, t) for which pi exists. Secondly, we consider the problem of finding two plane Hamiltonian paths pi_1, pi_2 on a set S with constraints given by a segment ab, where a, b in S. We consider the following scenarios: (i) pi_1 and pi_2 share no edges and ab is an edge of pi_1; (ii) pi_1 and pi_2 share no edges and none of them includes ab as an edge; (iii) both pi_1 and pi_2 include ab as an edge and share no other edges. In all cases, we characterize those triples (S, a, b) for which pi_1 and pi_2 exist.
