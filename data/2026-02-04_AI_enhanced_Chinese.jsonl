However, existing evaluations rely on static difficulty labels and simplistic metrics, which fail to capture the dynamic nature of difficulty relative to varying model capacities. Consequently, they obscure the distinction between adaptive mode selection and general performance while neglecting fine-grained process analyses. In this paper, we propose AdaptMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for adaptive multimodal reasoning across five domains: real-world, OCR, GUI, knowledge, and math, encompassing both direct perception and complex reasoning tasks. AdaptMMBench utilizes a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metric to evaluate the selection rationality of different reasoning modes, isolating this meta-cognition ability by dynamically identifying task difficulties based on models' capability boundaries. Moreover, AdaptMMBench facilitates multi-dimensional process evaluation across key step coverage, tool effectiveness, and computational efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that while adaptive mode selection scales with model capacity, it notably decouples from final accuracy. Conversely, key step coverage aligns with performance, though tool effectiveness remains highly inconsistent across model architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdaptMMBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u96be\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3001\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff09\u6765\u5168\u9762\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u96be\u5ea6\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdaptMMBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e94\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u3001OCR\u3001GUI\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u6570\u5b66\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Matthews\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff08MCC\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u5224\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u4ece\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u529b\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u5de5\u5177\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaptMMBench\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, these scores often fail to match users' day to day experience, because system prompts, output protocols, and interaction modes evolve under routine iteration, and in agentic multi step pipelines small protocol shifts can trigger disproportionate failures, leaving practitioners uncertain about which model to deploy. We propose CreditAudit, a deployment oriented credit audit framework that evaluates models under a family of semantically aligned and non adversarial system prompt templates across multiple benchmarks, reporting mean ability as average performance across scenarios and scenario induced fluctuation sigma as a stability risk signal, and further mapping volatility into interpretable credit grades from AAA to BBB via cross model quantiles with diagnostics that mitigate template difficulty drift. Controlled experiments on GPQA, TruthfulQA, and MMLU Pro show that models with similar mean ability can exhibit substantially different fluctuation, and stability risk can overturn prioritization decisions in agentic or high failure cost regimes. By providing a 2D and grade based language for regime specific selection, CreditAudit supports tiered deployment and more disciplined allocation of testing and monitoring effort, enabling more objective and trustworthy model evaluation for real world use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCreditAudit\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\uff08mean ability\uff09\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\uff08sigma\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6620\u5c04\u4e3aAAA\u81f3BBB\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u7b49\u7ea7\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6392\u884c\u699c\u5206\u6570\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6CreditAudit\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u975e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\uff08sigma\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u5c06\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u7b49\u7ea7\uff08AAA\u2013BBB\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bca\u65ad\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u677f\u96be\u5ea6\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPQA\u3001TruthfulQA\u548cMMLU Pro\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u8fd1\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u9ad8\u5931\u8d25\u6210\u672c\u6216\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u53ef\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "conclusion": "CreditAudit\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u7ef4\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u80fd\u529b+\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u548c\u7b49\u7ea7\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6309\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5c42\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u76d1\u63a7\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

This paper introduces data-driven silicon sociology as a systematic empirical framework for studying social structure formation among interacting artificial agents. We present a pioneering large-scale data mining investigation of an in-the-wild agent society by analyzing Moltbook, a social platform designed primarily for agent-to-agent interaction. At the time of study, Moltbook hosted over 150,000 registered autonomous agents operating across thousands of agent-created sub-communities. Using programmatic and non-intrusive data acquisition, we collected and analyzed the textual descriptions of 12,758 submolts, which represent proactive sub-community partitioning activities within the ecosystem. Treating agent-authored descriptions as first-class observational artifacts, we apply rigorous preprocessing, contextual embedding, and unsupervised clustering techniques to uncover latent patterns of thematic organization and social space structuring. The results show that autonomous agents systematically organize collective space through reproducible patterns spanning human-mimetic interests, silicon-centric self-reflection, and early-stage economic and coordination behaviors. Rather than relying on predefined sociological taxonomies, these structures emerge directly from machine-generated data traces. This work establishes a methodological foundation for data-driven silicon sociology and demonstrates that data mining techniques can provide a powerful lens for understanding the organization and evolution of large autonomous agent societies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7845\u57fa\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u201d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6316\u6398\u771f\u5b9e\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u793e\u4ea4\u5e73\u53f0Moltbook\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u65e0\u9884\u8bbe\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0b\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u4e2a\u6848\u89c2\u5bdf\u6216\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9Moltbook\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d12,758\u4e2a\u7531\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u5b50\u793e\u533a\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u672c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e3b\u9898\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u96c6\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u5174\u8da3\u3001\u7845\u57fa\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e9\u671f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\u4e3b\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7845\u57fa\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0e\u6f14\u5316\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002"}}

Although theoretical optimal solutions exist for simple cases, the problem's NP-hard characteristic makes the problem computationally intractable for complex polygons with numerous circles. Prevailing methods are largely confined to regular domains, while the few algorithms designed for irregular polygons suffer from poor initialization, unmanaged boundary effects, and excessive overlap among circles, resulting in low coverage efficiency. Consequently, we propose an Improved Quasi-Physical Dynamic(IQPD) algorithm for arbitrary convex polygons. Our core contributions are threefold: (1) proposing a structure-preserving initialization strategy that maps a hexagonal close-packing of circles into the target polygon via scaling and affine transformation; (2) constructing a virtual force field incorporating friction and a radius-expansion optimization iteration model; (3) designing a boundary-surrounding strategy based on normal and tangential gradients to retrieve overflowing circles. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms four state-of-the-art methods on seven metrics across a variety of convex polygons.

Traditional manual landmarking is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while rule-based methods are often tailored to specific geometries or limited sets of landmarks. In recent years, anatomical surfaces have been effectively represented as point clouds, which are lightweight structures composed of spatial coordinates. Following this strategy and to overcome the limitations of existing landmarking techniques, we propose Landmark Point Transformer (LmPT), a method for automatic anatomical landmark detection on point clouds that can leverage homologous bones from different species for translational research. The LmPT model incorporates a conditioning mechanism that enables adaptability to different input types to conduct cross-species learning.

However, while smaller agents can closely match larger ones on simple tasks, it remains unclear how their performance scales with task complexity, when large models become necessary, and how to better leverage small agents for long-horizon workloads. In this work, we empirically show that small agents' performance fails to scale with task complexity on deep search and coding tasks, and we introduce Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency (SALE), an agent framework inspired by freelancer marketplaces. In SALE, agents bid with short strategic plans, which are scored by a systematic cost-value mechanism and refined via a shared auction memory, enabling per-task routing and continual self-improvement without training a separate router or running all models to completion. Across deep search and coding tasks of varying complexity, SALE reduces reliance on the largest agent by 53%, lowers overall cost by 35%, and consistently improves upon the largest agent's pass@1 with only a negligible overhead beyond executing the final trace. In contrast, established routers that rely on task descriptions either underperform the largest agent or fail to reduce cost -- often both -- underscoring their poor fit for agentic workflows. These results suggest that while small agents may be insufficient for complex workloads, they can be effectively \"scaled up\" through coordinated task allocation and test-time self-improvement. More broadly, they motivate a systems-level view of agentic AI in which performance gains come less from ever-larger individual models and more from market-inspired coordination mechanisms that organize heterogeneous agents into efficient, adaptive ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSALE\uff08Strategy Auctions for Workload Efficiency\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u81ea\u7531\u804c\u4e1a\u5e02\u573a\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7ade\u62cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u5927\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5468\u671f\u3001\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSALE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4ea4\u7b80\u77ed\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u6848\u53c2\u4e0e\u201c\u7ade\u62cd\u201d\uff0c\u7531\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u6210\u672c-\u4ef7\u503c\u673a\u5236\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u201c\u62cd\u5356\u8bb0\u5fc6\u201d\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6309\u4efb\u52a1\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u548c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSALE\u5c06\u5bf9\u6700\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u964d\u4f4e53%\uff0c\u603b\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e35%\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684pass@1\uff0c\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u65e0\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c0f\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u867d\u96be\u4ee5\u72ec\u7acb\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982SALE\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u201d\uff1b\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7684\u672a\u6765\u589e\u76ca\u5e94\u66f4\u591a\u6765\u81ea\u5f02\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u589e\u5927\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3002"}}

Effective anonymization relies on the exhaustive localization of every individual; even a single missed detection necessitates extensive manual correction. However, existing approaches face two critical scalability bottlenecks: (1) they usually require manual annotations of each new clinical site for high accuracy; (2) while multi-camera setups have been widely adopted to address single-view ambiguity, camera calibration is typically required whenever cameras are repositioned. To address these problems, we propose a novel self-supervised multi-view video anonymization framework consisting of whole-body person detection and whole-body pose estimation, without annotation or camera calibration. Our core strategy is to enhance the single-view detector by \"retrieving\" false negatives using temporal and multi-view context, and conducting self-supervised domain adaptation. We first run an off-the-shelf whole-body person detector in each view with a low-score threshold to gather candidate detections. Then, we retrieve the low-score false negatives that exhibit consistency with the high-score detections via tracking and self-supervised uncalibrated multi-view association. These recovered detections serve as pseudo labels to iteratively fine-tune the whole-body detector. Finally, we apply whole-body pose estimation on each detected person, and fine-tune the pose model using its own high-score predictions. Experiments on the 4D-OR dataset of simulated surgeries and our dataset of real surgeries show the effectiveness of our approach achieving over 97% recall. Moreover, we train a real-time whole-body detector using our pseudo labels, achieving comparable performance and highlighting our method's practical applicability.

This paper studies how uncertainty and fairness evaluations affect the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of LLM-generated recommendations. We introduce a benchmark of curated metrics and a dataset annotated for eight demographic attributes (31 categorical values) across two domains: movies and music. Through in-depth case studies, we quantify predictive uncertainty (via entropy) and demonstrate that Google DeepMind's Gemini 1.5 Flash exhibits systematic unfairness for certain sensitive attributes; measured similarity-based gaps are SNSR at 0.1363 and SNSV at 0.0507. These disparities persist under prompt perturbations such as typographical errors and multilingual inputs. We further integrate personality-aware fairness into the RecLLM evaluation pipeline to reveal personality-linked bias patterns and expose trade-offs between personalization and group fairness. We propose a novel uncertainty-aware evaluation methodology for RecLLMs, present empirical insights from deep uncertainty case studies, and introduce a personality profile-informed fairness benchmark that advances explainability and equity in LLM recommendations. Together, these contributions establish a foundation for safer, more interpretable RecLLMs and motivate future work on multi-model benchmarks and adaptive calibration for trustworthy deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793aGemini 1.5 Flash\u5728\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5185\u5d4c\u504f\u89c1\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u7535\u5f71\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u4e24\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u4e868\u4e2a\u654f\u611f\u4eba\u53e3\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u517131\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u6307\u6807\uff08SNSR/SNSV\uff09\u8861\u91cf\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u62fc\u5199\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u5165\uff09\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u683c\u611f\u77e5\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6574\u5408\u8fdbRecLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0Gemini 1.5 Flash\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\uff08SNSR=0.1363\uff0cSNSV=0.0507\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u504f\u5dee\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u683c\u753b\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4eba\u683c\u753b\u50cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u578b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08RecLLM\uff09\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u5c55\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6821\u51c6\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u4fe1\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

The dominant approach, Multi-Agent Path Finding, relies on centralized control and synchronous collision avoidance, which often requires strict synchronization and guarantees of globally conflict-free execution. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Routing under Crossing Cost model on mixed graphs, a novel framework tailored to asynchronous settings. In our model, instead of treating conflicts as hard constraints, each agent is assigned a path, and the system is evaluated through a cost function that measures potential head-on encounters. This ``crossing cost'', which is defined as the product of the numbers of agents traversing an edge in opposite directions, quantifies the risk of congestion and delay in decentralized execution.\n  Our contributions are both game-theoretic and algorithmic. We model the setting as a congestion game with a non-standard cost function, prove the existence of pure Nash equilibria, and analyze the dynamics leading to them. Equilibria can be found in polynomial time under mild conditions, while the general case is PLS-complete. From an optimization perspective, minimizing the total crossing cost is NP-hard, as the problem generalizes Steiner Orientation. To address this hardness barrier, we design a suite of parameterized algorithms for minimizing crossing cost, with parameters including the number of arcs, edges, agents, and structural graph measures. These yield XP or FPT results depending on the parameter, offering algorithmic strategies for structurally restricted instances. Our framework provides a new theoretical foundation for decentralized multi-agent routing, bridging equilibrium analysis and parameterized complexity to support scalable and risk-aware coordination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\u2014\u2014\u201c\u4ea4\u53c9\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6a21\u578b\u201d\uff0c\u5c06\u51b2\u7a81\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u4ef7\u800c\u975e\u786c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u6b65\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff08\u5982MAPF\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u96c6\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u907f\u78b0\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5f02\u6b65\u3001\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u4ef7\u51fd\u6570\u8861\u91cf\u51b2\u7a81\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u4ee3\u4ef7\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u62e5\u585e\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7eaf\u7b56\u7565\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u53ca\u6536\u655b\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u603b\u4ea4\u53c9\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u627e\u5230\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u662fPLS-\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff1b\u603b\u4ea4\u53c9\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u662fNP-\u96be\u7684\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u6709\u5411\u8fb9\u6570\u3001\u65e0\u5411\u8fb9\u6570\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u3001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86XP\u6216FPT\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u535a\u5f08\u5747\u8861\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

ViThinker internalizes vision-expert capabilities during training, performing generative mental simulation during inference without external tool calls. Through a two-stage curriculum: first distilling frozen experts into model parameters, then learning task-driven querying via sparsity penalties, i.e., ViThinker discovers minimal sufficient perception for each reasoning step.

When a team operates in an uncoordinated manner, and agents choose actions that are only individually optimal, the team's outcome can suffer. However, in many domains, coordination requires costly communication. We explore the value of coordination in a broad class of differentiable motion-planning problems. In particular, we model coordinated behavior as a spectrum: at one extreme, agents jointly optimize a common team objective, and at the other, agents make unilaterally optimal decisions given their individual decision variables, i.e., they operate at Nash equilibria. We then demonstrate that reasoning about coordination in differentiable motion-planning problems reduces to reasoning about the second-order properties of agents' objectives, and we provide algorithms that use this second-order reasoning to determine at which times a team of agents should coordinate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e2\u961f\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u8c03\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3a\u4ece\u5b8c\u5168\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5230\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u6027\u8d28\u5224\u65ad\u4f55\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u534f\u8c03\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u534f\u8c03\u53c8\u5e38\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u5728\u54ea\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u534f\u8c03\u662f\u503c\u5f97\u7684\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u534f\u8c03\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\uff0c\u4e00\u7aef\u662f\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u56e2\u961f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u7aef\u662f\u4e2a\u4f53\u5728\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u4e0b\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u51b3\u7b56\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u6027\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5224\u65ad\u4f55\u65f6\u5e94\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u9700\u6c42\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u5b9a\u534f\u8c03\u65f6\u673a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

We introduce a contrastive, document-aware reference selection framework that constructs compact evidence sets optimized for discrimination rather than similarity by explicitly balancing visual relevance, embedding diversity, and source-level provenance using ROCO embeddings and metadata. While ROCO provides large-scale image-caption pairs, it does not specify how references should be selected for contrastive reasoning, and naive retrieval frequently yields near-duplicate figures from the same document. To address this gap, we release a reproducible reference selection protocol and curated reference bank that enable a systematic study of contrastive retrieval in medical image reasoning. Building on these contrastive evidence sets, we propose Counterfactual-Contrastive Inference, a confidence-aware reasoning framework that performs structured pairwise visual comparisons and aggregates evidence using margin-based decision rules with faithful abstention.

Existing faithfulness metrics have critical limitations, typically relying on identifying unfaithfulness via adversarial prompting or detecting reasoning errors. These methods overlook the predictive value of explanations. We introduce Normalized Simulatability Gain (NSG), a general and scalable metric based on the idea that a faithful explanation should allow an observer to learn a model's decision-making criteria, and thus better predict its behavior on related inputs. We evaluate 18 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, e.g., Gemini 3, GPT-5.2, and Claude 4.5, on 7,000 counterfactuals from popular datasets covering health, business, and ethics. We find self-explanations substantially improve prediction of model behavior (11-37% NSG). Self-explanations also provide more predictive information than explanations generated by external models, even when those models are stronger. This implies an advantage from self-knowledge that external explanation methods cannot replicate. Our approach also reveals that, across models, 5-15% of self-explanations are egregiously misleading.

We present FaceLinkGen, an identity extraction attack that performs linkage/matching and face regeneration directly from protected templates without recovering original pixels. On three recent PPFR systems, FaceLinkGen reaches over 98.5\\% matching accuracy and above 96\\% regeneration success, and still exceeds 92\\% matching and 94\\% regeneration in a near zero knowledge setting.

MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source frameworks on MLE-Bench under comparable settings, maintaining competitiveness with the global leaderboard's top methods.

The reason being that synthetic and real medical images exist in different semantic feature spaces, creating a domain gap that current semi-supervised learning methods cannot bridge. We propose SRA-Seg, a framework explicitly designed to align synthetic and real feature distributions for medical image segmentation. SRA-Seg introduces a similarity-alignment (SA) loss using frozen DINOv2 embeddings to pull synthetic representations toward their nearest real counterparts in semantic space. We employ soft edge blending to create smooth anatomical transitions and continuous labels, eliminating the hard boundaries from traditional copy-paste augmentation. The framework generates pseudo-labels for synthetic images via an EMA teacher model and applies soft-segmentation losses that respect uncertainty in mixed regions. Our experiments demonstrate strong results: using only 10% labeled real data and 90% synthetic unlabeled data, SRA-Seg achieves 89.34% Dice on ACDC and 84.42% on FIVES, significantly outperforming existing semi-supervised methods and matching the performance of methods using real unlabeled data.", "AI": {"tldr": "SRA-Seg\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8f6f\u8fb9\u7f18\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752810%\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5168\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5408\u6210\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u867d\u5177\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u57df\u95f4\u9699\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5176\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSRA-Seg\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3DINOv2\u5d4c\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08SA\uff09\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u62c9\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u8fb9\u7f18\u878d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7EMA\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u533a\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8f6f\u5206\u5272\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ec510%\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e+90%\u5408\u6210\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cACDC\u6570\u636e\u96c6Dice\u8fbe89.34%\uff0cFIVES\u8fbe84.42%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0cSRA-Seg\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u57df\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u4f7f\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While practitioners commonly believe a higher task success rate necessitates the use of a larger and stronger LLM model, multi-step interaction with a large LLM incurs prohibitive inference cost. To address this problem, we explore the use of low-precision quantized LLM in the long-horizon decision-making process. Based on the observation of diverse sensitivities among interaction steps, we propose a dynamic mix-precision routing framework that adaptively selects between high-precision and low-precision LLMs at each decision step.

Process verification, which evaluates intermediate steps in trajectories, has shown promise in general reasoning settings, and has been suggested as a potential tool for guiding coordination of MAS; however, its actual effectiveness in MAS remains unclear. To fill this gap, we present MAS-ProVe, a systematic empirical study of process verification for multi-agent systems (MAS). Our study spans three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, and process reward models), evaluated across two levels of verification granularity (agent-level and iteration-level). We further examine five representative verifiers and four context management strategies, and conduct experiments over six diverse MAS frameworks on multiple reasoning benchmarks. We find that process-level verification does not consistently improve performance and frequently exhibits high variance, highlighting the difficulty of reliably evaluating partial multi-agent trajectories. Among the methods studied, LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforms reward-based approaches, with trained judges surpassing general-purpose LLMs. We further observe a small performance gap between LLMs acting as judges and as single agents, and identify a context-length-performance trade-off in verification. Overall, our results suggest that effective and robust process verification for MAS remains an open challenge, requiring further advances beyond current paradigms.

However, existing pruning methods demonstrate excellent performance preservation in visual question answering (VQA) and suffer substantial degradation on visual grounding (VG) tasks. Our analysis of the VLM's processing pipeline reveals that strategies utilizing global semantic similarity and attention scores lose the global spatial reference frame, which is derived from the interactions of tokens' positional information. Motivated by these findings, we propose $\\text{N\u00fcwa}$, a two-stage token pruning framework that enables efficient feature aggregation while maintaining spatial integrity. In the first stage, after the vision encoder, we apply three operations, namely separation, alignment, and aggregation, which are inspired by swarm intelligence algorithms to retain information-rich global spatial anchors. In the second stage, within the LLM, we perform text-guided pruning to retain task-relevant visual tokens.

Such architectures either omit the geometric groundings requisite for mitigating structural hallucinations or impose inflexible modality fusion bottlenecks that concurrently over-compress and suboptimally allocate structural tokens, thereby impeding the realization of generalized all-atom reasoning. We introduce Cuttlefish, a unified all-atom LLM that grounds language reasoning in geometric cues while scaling modality tokens with structural complexity. First, Scaling-Aware Patching leverages an instruction-conditioned gating mechanism to generate variable-size patches over structural graphs, adaptively scaling the query token budget with structural complexity to mitigate fixed-length connector bottlenecks.

Given a prior and current chest X-ray, TRACE generates natural language descriptions of interval changes (worsened, improved, stable) while grounding each finding with bounding box coordinates. TRACE demonstrates effective spatial localization with over 90% grounding accuracy, establishing a foundation for this challenging new task. Our ablation study uncovers an emergent capability: change detection arises only when temporal comparison and spatial grounding are jointly learned, as neither alone enables meaningful change detection.

This limitation is particularly problematic in ordinal decision settings such as clinical triage, where standard alignment removes the ability to trade off specificity and sensitivity (the ROC operating point) based on contextual constraints. We propose STEER (Steerable Tuning via Evolutionary Ensemble Refinement), a training-free framework that reintroduces this tunable control. STEER constructs a population of natural-language personas through an offline, constrained quality-diversity search that promotes behavioral coverage while enforcing minimum safety, reasoning, and stability thresholds. At inference time, STEER exposes a single, interpretable control parameter that maps a user-specified risk percentile to a selected persona, yielding a monotonic adjustment of decision conservativeness. On two clinical triage benchmarks, STEER achieves broader behavioral coverage compared to temperature-based sampling and static persona ensembles. Compared to a representative post-training method, STEER maintains substantially higher accuracy on unambiguous urgent cases while providing comparable control over ambiguous decisions.

Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires hierarchical semantics capturing both global context and localized details across visual and textual domains.

We propose CAFT (Cross-domain Alignment of Forests and Trees), a hierarchical image-text representation learning framework that aligns global and local semantics across images and long captions without pixel-level supervision. Coupling a fine-to-coarse visual encoder with a hierarchical text transformer, it uses a hierarchical alignment loss that matches whole images with whole captions while biasing region-sentence correspondences, so that coarse semantics are built from fine-grained evidence rather than from aggregation untethered to part-level grounding. Trained on 30M image-text pairs, CAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six long-text retrieval benchmarks and exhibits strong scaling behavior.

Recent progress in Gaussian-based representations has significantly improved real-time rendering quality, yet existing methods still struggle to maintain a balance between long-term static and short-term dynamic regions in both representation and optimization. To address this, we present SharpTimeGS, a lifespan-aware 4D Gaussian framework that achieves temporally adaptive modeling of both static and dynamic regions under a unified representation. Specifically, we introduce a learnable lifespan parameter that reformulates temporal visibility from a Gaussian-shaped decay into a flat-top profile, allowing primitives to remain consistently active over their intended duration and avoiding redundant densification. In addition, the learned lifespan modulates each primitives' motion, reducing drift in long-lived static points while retaining unrestricted motion for short-lived dynamic ones. This effectively decouples motion magnitude from temporal duration, improving long-term stability without compromising dynamic fidelity. Moreover, we design a lifespan-velocity-aware densification strategy that mitigates optimization imbalance between static and dynamic regions by allocating more capacity to regions with pronounced motion while keeping static areas compact and stable.

We propose Video-OPD, an efficient post-training framework for TVG inspired by recent advances in on-policy distillation. Video-OPD optimizes trajectories sampled directly from the current policy, thereby preserving alignment between training and inference distributions, while a frontier teacher supplies dense, token-level supervision via a reverse KL divergence objective. This formulation preserves the on-policy property critical for mitigating distributional shift, while converting sparse, episode-level feedback into fine-grained, step-wise learning signals. Building on Video-OPD, we introduce Teacher-Validated Disagreement Focusing (TVDF), a lightweight training curriculum that iteratively prioritizes trajectories that are both teacher-reliable and maximally informative for the student, thereby improving training efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that Video-OPD consistently outperforms GRPO while achieving substantially faster convergence and lower computational cost, establishing on-policy distillation as an effective alternative to conventional reinforcement learning for TVG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVideo-OPD\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c6\u9891\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08TVG\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u9010token\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6559\u5e08\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u805a\u7126\u7b56\u7565\uff08TVDF\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728TVG\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "Video-OPD\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u524d\u6cbf\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684token\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165TVDF\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3\u6559\u5e08\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVideo-OPD\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684TVG\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks face a trade-off: they either heavily rely on LLM-as-judge evaluations of automatically generated research outputs or optimize convenient yet isolated performance metrics that provide coarse proxies for scientific insight. To address this gap, we introduce FIRE-Bench (Full-cycle Insight Rediscovery Evaluation), a benchmark that evaluates agents through the rediscovery of established findings from recent, high-impact machine learning research. Agents are given only a high-level research question extracted from a published, verified study and must autonomously explore ideas, design experiments, implement code, execute their plans, and derive conclusions supported by empirical evidence.

We introduce VOILA, a framework for Value-Of-Information-driven adaptive fidelity selection in Visual Question Answering (VQA) that optimizes what information to retrieve before model execution. Given a query, VOILA uses a two-stage pipeline: a gradient-boosted regressor estimates correctness likelihood at each fidelity from question features alone, then an isotonic calibrator refines these probabilities for reliable decision-making. The system selects the minimum-cost fidelity maximizing expected utility given predicted accuracy and retrieval costs. We evaluate VOILA across three deployment scenarios using five datasets (VQA-v2, GQA, TextVQA, LoCoMo, FloodNet) and six Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with 7B-235B parameters.

By extending the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model--an abstraction of LLMs that quantifies the information flow required to solve a task--we prove lower bounds on the CoT tokens required for three canonical BAPO-hard tasks: binary majority, triplet matching, and graph reachability. We show that each requires $\u03a9(n)$ reasoning tokens when the input size is $n$. We complement these results with matching or near-matching upper bounds via explicit constructions.

Recent studies intuitively identify the high-frequency structure and low-frequency texture to be extracted by CNNs from the encoder, and subsequently for a desirable upsampling recovery. However, the existing arts inevitably overlook the information loss for both structure and texture feature maps during the convolutional downsampling process, hence suffer from a non-ideal upsampling output. In this paper, we systematically answer whether and how the structure and texture feature map can mutually help to alleviate the information loss during the convolutional downsampling. Given the structure and texture feature maps, we adopt the statistical normalization and denormalization strategy for the reconstruction guidance during the convolutional downsampling process. The extensive experimental results validate its advantages to the state-of-the-arts over the images from low-to-high resolutions including 256*256 and 512*512, especially holds by substituting all the encoders by ours.

In this work, we first formalize the evolutionary agents as a general Expectation-Maximization framework, where the language model samples candidate programs (E-step) and the system updates the control context based on evaluation feedback (M-step). Under this view, constructing context via full-code snapshots constitutes a suboptimal M-step, as redundant implement details dilutes core algorithmic ideas, making it difficult to provide clear inspirations for evolution. To address this, we propose DeltaEvolve, a momentum-driven evolutionary framework that replaces full-code history with structured semantic delta capturing how and why modifications between successive nodes affect performance. As programs are often decomposable, semantic delta usually contains many effective components which are transferable and more informative to drive improvement. By organizing semantic delta through multi-level database and progressive disclosure mechanism, input tokens are further reduced. Empirical evaluations on tasks across diverse scientific domains show that our framework can discover better solution with less token consumption over full-code-based evolutionary agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDeltaEvolve\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\uff08semantic delta\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587token\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982AlphaEvolve\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b\u5197\u4f59\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8fdb\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u671f\u671b\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff08EM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1aE\u6b65\u7531\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u5019\u9009\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0cM\u6b65\u6839\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u53cd\u9988\u66f4\u65b0\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u4ee3\u66ff\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u5feb\u7167\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0e\u6e10\u8fdb\u62ab\u9732\u673a\u5236\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cDeltaEvolve\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u5c11token\u6d88\u8017\u4e0b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u8fdb\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically rely on feed-forward pipelines or prompt-only refinement, which often leads to semantic drift and identity inconsistency as sequences grow longer. We address this challenge by formulating storytelling as a closed-loop constraint enforcement problem and propose MUSE, a multi-agent framework that coordinates generation through an iterative plan-execute-verify-revise loop. MUSE translates narrative intent into explicit, machine-executable controls over identity, spatial composition, and temporal continuity, and applies targeted multimodal feedback to correct violations during generation. To evaluate open-ended storytelling without ground-truth references, we introduce MUSEBench, a reference-free evaluation protocol validated by human judgments.

We propose \\emph{GCR-RL} (Geometric Coherence Regularized Reinforcement Learning) that computes a sequence of super-poset refinements -- by refining posets in previous steps and learning additional order relationships from temporal difference signals -- thus ensuring geometric coherence across the sequence of posets underpinning the learned value functions. Two novel algorithms by Q-learning and by actor--critic are developed to efficiently realize these super-poset refinements. Their theoretical properties and convergence rates are analyzed.

Causal Reasoning as a Function of Prior Knowledge, Irrelevant Information, and Reasoning Budget", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in domains where causal reasoning matters, yet it remains unclear whether their judgments reflect normative causal computation, human-like shortcuts, or brittle pattern matching. We benchmark 20+ LLMs against a matched human baseline on 11 causal judgment tasks formalized by a collider structure ($C_1 \\!\\rightarrow\\! E\\! \\leftarrow \\!C_2$). We find that a small interpretable model compresses LLMs' causal judgments well and that most LLMs exhibit more rule-like reasoning strategies than humans who seem to account for unmentioned latent factors in their probability judgments. Furthermore, most LLMs do not mirror the characteristic human collider biases of weak explaining away and Markov violations. We probe LLMs' causal judgment robustness under (i) semantic abstraction and (ii) prompt overloading (injecting irrelevant text), and find that chain-of-thought (CoT) increases robustness for many LLMs. Together, this divergence suggests LLMs can complement humans when known biases are undesirable, but their rule-like reasoning may break down when uncertainty is intrinsic -- highlighting the need to characterize LLM reasoning strategies for safe, effective deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc711\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u649e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5224\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd420\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u5316\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5219\u8003\u8651\u672a\u660e\u793a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u7d20\uff1bLLMs\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5178\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u649e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4f46\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u7c7b\u4eba\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f02\u540c\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u572811\u4e2a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5bf9\u649e\u7ed3\u6784\uff08$C_1 \\rightarrow E \\leftarrow C_2$\uff09\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5224\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf920\u591a\u4e2aLLMs\u4e0e\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29LLMs\u7684\u5224\u65ad\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u8fc7\u8f7d\uff08\u6ce8\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u6587\u672c\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u63a2\u6d4bLLMs\u56e0\u679c\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u5bdf\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570LLMs\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6982\u7387\u5224\u65ad\u4e2d\u4f1a\u8003\u8651\u672a\u63d0\u53ca\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u7d20\uff1bLLMs\u666e\u904d\u4e0d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4eba\u7c7b\u5178\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u649e\u504f\u5dee\uff08\u5982\u5f31\u89e3\u91ca\u6d88\u9664\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fdd\u53cd\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\uff0cLLMs\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46CoT\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u5df2\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d6\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u523b\u753b\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

A significant challenge, however, is their prohibitive inference cost when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods that primarily focus on semantic relevance often discard tokens that are crucial for spatial reasoning. We address this gap through a novel insight into \\emph{how LVLMs process spatial reasoning}. Specifically, we reveal that LVLMs implicitly establish visual coordinate systems through Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), where specific token positions serve as \\textbf{implicit visual coordinates} (IVC tokens) that are essential for spatial reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose \\textbf{IVC-Prune}, a training-free, prompt-aware pruning strategy that retains both IVC tokens and semantically relevant foreground tokens. IVC tokens are identified by theoretically analyzing the mathematical properties of RoPE, targeting positions at which its rotation matrices approximate identity matrix or the $90^\\circ$ rotation matrix. Foreground tokens are identified through a robust two-stage process: semantic seed discovery followed by contextual refinement via value-vector similarity. Extensive evaluations across four representative LVLMs and twenty diverse benchmarks show that IVC-Prune reduces visual tokens by approximately 50\\% while maintaining $\\geq$ 99\\% of the original performance and even achieving improvements on several benchmarks.

Recent approaches tackle this task by utilizing Gaussian-based temporal proposals to represent query-relevant segments. However, their inference strategies rely on heuristic mappings from Gaussian parameters to segment boundaries, resulting in suboptimal localization performance. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Boundary Optimization (GBO), a novel inference framework that predicts segment boundaries by solving a principled optimization problem that balances proposal coverage and segment compactness. We derive a closed-form solution for this problem and rigorously analyze the optimality conditions under varying penalty regimes. Beyond its theoretical foundations, GBO offers several practical advantages: it is training-free and compatible with both single-Gaussian and mixture-based proposal architectures. Our experiments show that GBO significantly improves localization, achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and generalizability of GBO across various proposal schemes.

In effect, many contemporary machine learning systems already implement social choice mechanisms, often implicitly and without explicit normative scrutiny.\n  This Review surveys differentiable social choice: an emerging paradigm that formulates voting rules, mechanisms, and aggregation procedures as learnable, differentiable models optimized from data. We synthesize work across auctions, voting, budgeting, liquid democracy, decentralized aggregation, and inverse mechanism learning, showing how classical axioms and impossibility results reappear as objectives, constraints, and optimization trade-offs.

Active distillation reduces these costs by querying an LLM oracle to train compact discriminative students, but most pipelines distill only final labels, discarding intermediate reasoning signals and offering limited diagnostics of what reasoning is missing and where errors arise. We propose Graph of Concept Predictors (GCP), a reasoning-aware active distillation framework that externalizes the teacher's decision process as a directed acyclic graph and mirrors it with modular concept predictors in the student. GCP enhances sample efficiency through a graph-aware acquisition strategy that targets uncertainty and disagreement at critical reasoning nodes. Additionally, it improves training stability and efficiency by performing targeted sub-module retraining, which attributes downstream loss to specific concept predictors and updates only the most influential modules. Experiments on eight NLP classification benchmarks demonstrate that GCP enhances performance under limited annotation budgets while yielding more interpretable and controllable training dynamics.

With recent large-scale foundation models showing strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks including classification and segmentation, there has been interest in using the internal feature maps of these models for the semantic correspondence task. Recent works observe that features from DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion (SD) are complementary, the former producing accurate but sparse correspondences, while the latter produces spatially consistent correspondences. As a result, current state-of-the-art methods for semantic correspondence involve combining features from both models in an ensemble. While the performance of these methods is impressive, they are computationally expensive, requiring evaluating feature maps from large-scale foundation models. In this work we take a different approach, instead replacing SD features with a superior matching algorithm which is imbued with the desirable spatial consistency property. Specifically, we replace the standard nearest neighbours matching with an optimal transport algorithm that includes a Gromov Wasserstein spatial smoothness prior. We show that we can significantly boost the performance of the DINOv2 baseline, and be competitive and sometimes surpassing state-of-the-art methods using Stable Diffusion features, while being 5--10x more efficient.

However, existing paradigms are often plagued by overfitting, training instability, ineffective binary rewards for multi-solution tasks, and the difficulty of synergizing techniques. We introduce STAR: Similarity-guided Teacher-Assisted Refinement, a novel holistic framework that effectively transfers LLMs' capabilities to super-tiny models. STAR consists of two core technical innovations: (1) Constrained Knowledge Distillation (CKD), a training objective that augments top-k forward KL divergence to suppress confidently incorrect predictions, ensuring training stability while preserving exploration capacity for downstream RL. STAR holistically synergizes these strategies within a cohesive training curriculum, enabling super-tiny models to achieve exceptional performance on complex function calling tasks; (2) Similarity-guided RL (Sim-RL), a RL mechanism that introduces a fine-grained, similarity-based reward. This provides a robust, continuous, and rich signal for better policy optimization by evaluating the similarity between generated outputs and the ground truth.

Recent advances in generative models, such as conditional diffusion and few-shot NeRFs, offer a new paradigm for data augmentation by synthesizing data with significantly greater diversity and realism. However, unlike traditional augmentations like cropping or rotation, these methods introduce substantial changes that enhance robustness but also risk degrading performance if the augmentations are poorly matched to the task. In this work, we present EvoAug, an automated augmentation learning pipeline, which leverages these generative models alongside an efficient evolutionary algorithm to learn optimal task-specific augmentations. Our pipeline introduces a novel approach to image augmentation that learns stochastic augmentation trees that hierarchically compose augmentations, enabling more structured and adaptive transformations. We demonstrate strong performance across fine-grained classification and few-shot learning tasks. Notably, our pipeline discovers augmentations that align with domain knowledge, even in low-data settings.

A common recipe, SFT followed by GRPO, can stall when within-group reward variation is low (e.g., more rollouts in a group receive the all 0 or all 1 reward), making the group-normalized advantage uninformative and yielding vanishing updates. To address this problem, we propose RC-GRPO (Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization), which treats exploration as a controllable steering problem via discrete reward tokens. We first fine-tune a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal special tokens (e.g., <|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>) injected into the prompts, enabling the model to learn how to generate distinct quality trajectories on demand. Then during RL, we sample diverse reward tokens within each GRPO group and condition rollouts on the sampled token to improve within-group diversity, improving advantage gains.

Because of these challenges the task is underdetermined, where there exists multiple -- possibly infinite -- poses that are plausible given the image. Despite this, many prior works assume the existence of a deterministic mapping and estimate a single pose given an image. Furthermore, methods based on machine learning require a large amount of paired 2D-3D data to train and suffer from generalization issues to unseen scenarios. To address both of these issues, we propose a framework for pose estimation using diffusion models, which enables sampling from a probability distribution over plausible poses which are consistent with a 2D image. Our approach falls under the guidance framework for conditional generation, and guides samples from an unconditional diffusion model, trained only on 3D data, using the gradients of the heatmaps from a 2D keypoint detector. We evaluate our method on the Human 3.6M dataset under best-of-$m$ multiple hypothesis evaluation, showing state-of-the-art performance among methods which do not require paired 2D-3D data for training.

While effective on coarse-grained reasoning tasks, they suffer from significant performance degradation on tasks requiring fine-grained visual details. Through layer-wise analysis, we reveal substantial discrepancies in visual token importance across layers, showing that tokens deemed unimportant at shallow layers can later become highly relevant for text-conditioned reasoning. To avoid irreversible critical information loss caused by premature pruning, we introduce a new pruning paradigm, termed bypass, which preserves unselected visual tokens and forwards them to subsequent pruning stages for re-evaluation. Building on this paradigm, we propose SwiftVLM, a simple and training-free method that performs pruning at model-specific layers with strong visual token selection capability, while enabling independent pruning decisions across layers.

Existing agent safety evaluations rely on risk-oriented tasks tailored to specific agent settings, resulting in limited coverage of safety risk space and failing to assess agent safety behavior during long-horizon, interactive task execution in complex real-world deployments. Moreover, their specialization to particular agent settings limits adaptability across diverse agent configurations. To address these limitations, we propose Risky-Bench, a framework that enables systematic agent safety evaluation grounded in real-world deployment. Risky-Bench organizes evaluation around domain-agnostic safety principles to derive context-aware safety rubrics that delineate safety space, and systematically evaluates safety risks across this space through realistic task execution under varying threat assumptions. When applied to life-assist agent settings, Risky-Bench uncovers substantial safety risks in state-of-the-art agents under realistic execution conditions. Moreover, as a well-structured evaluation pipeline, Risky-Bench is not confined to life-assist scenarios and can be adapted to other deployment settings to construct environment-specific safety evaluations, providing an extensible methodology for agent safety assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Risky-Bench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u539f\u5219\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u5468\u671f\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u957f\u5468\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "Risky-Bench\u56f4\u7ed5\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u539f\u5219\u6784\u5efa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u5206\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5a01\u80c1\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u903c\u771f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u751f\u6d3b\u8f85\u52a9\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cRisky-Bench\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6267\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "Risky-Bench\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u826f\u597d\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6d3b\u8f85\u52a9\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u9002\u914d\u5176\u4ed6\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3002"}}

These frameworks impose distinct architectural structures that govern how agents interact, store information, and coordinate tasks. However, their impact on system performance remains poorly understood. This gap is critical, as architectural choices alone can induce order-of-magnitude differences in latency and throughput, as well as substantial variation in accuracy and scalability. Addressing this challenge requires (i) jointly evaluating multiple capabilities, such as orchestration overhead, memory behavior, planning, specialization, and coordination, and (ii) conducting these evaluations under controlled, framework-level conditions to isolate architectural effects. Existing benchmarks focus on individual capabilities and lack standardized framework-level evaluation. We address these limitations by (i) introducing an architectural taxonomy for systematically comparing multi-agent LLM frameworks along fundamental dimensions, and (ii) developing MAFBench, a unified evaluation suite that integrates existing benchmarks under a standardized execution pipeline. Using MAFBench, we conduct a controlled empirical study across several widely used frameworks. Our results show that framework-level design choices alone can increase latency by over 100x, reduce planning accuracy by up to 30%, and lower coordination success from above 90% to below 30%.

This study overcomes these limitations and introduces the first fully KA-based deep model, demonstrating that KA-based layers can entirely replace traditional architectures in deep learning and achieve superior learning capacity. Specifically, (1) the proposed Share-activation KAN (SaKAN) reformulates Sprecher's variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which achieves better optimization due to its simplified parameterization and denser training samples, to ease training difficulty, (2) this paper indicates that spline gradients contribute negligibly to training while consuming huge GPU memory, thus proposes the Grad-Free Spline to significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead. (3) Building on these two innovations, our ALL U-KAN is the first representative implementation of fully KA-based deep model, where the proposed KA and KAonv layers completely replace FC and Conv layers. Extensive evaluations on three medical image segmentation tasks confirm the superiority of the full KA-based architecture compared to partial KA-based and traditional architectures, achieving all higher segmentation accuracy.

In [10], it was shown that, within a particular framework, every almost optimal and general agent necessarily contains sufficient knowledge of its environment to allow an approximate reconstruction of it by querying the agent as a black box. This result relied on the assumptions that the agent is deterministic and that the environment is fully observable.\n  In this work, we remove both assumptions by extending the theorem to stochastic agents operating in partially observable environments. Fundamentally, this shows that stochastic agents cannot avoid learning their environment through the usage of randomization. We also strengthen the result by weakening the notion of generality, proving that less powerful agents already contain a model of the world in which they operate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5fc5\u987b\u5305\u542b\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u4ece\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f31\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u7528\u6027\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c[10]\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5fc5\u7136\u5305\u542b\u5176\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8db3\u591f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9ed1\u76d2\u67e5\u8be2\u8fd1\u4f3c\u91cd\u5efa\u73af\u5883\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8be5\u7ed3\u8bba\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u53bb\u9664\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u987b\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u539f\u6709\u5b9a\u7406\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u968f\u673a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f31\u5316\u201c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u201d\u8fd9\u4e00\u524d\u63d0\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u66f4\u5bbd\u677e\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ecd\u9700\u5305\u542b\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6765\u907f\u514d\u5b66\u4e60\u5176\u73af\u5883\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u539f\u5148\u6240\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5f3a\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e5f\u5df2\u5185\u542b\u5176\u6240\u5904\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5176\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u8bba\u5728\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\uff08\u968f\u673a\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\uff09\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f31\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002"}}

This human-in-the-loop adaptation is employed in a group-activity video retrieval framework to improve its retrieval performance. Our method initially pre-trains the GAF space based on the similarity of group activities in a self-supervised manner, unlike prior work that classifies videos into pre-defined group activity classes in a supervised learning manner. Our interactive fine-tuning process updates the GAF space to allow a user to better retrieve videos similar to query videos given by the user. In this fine-tuning, our proposed data-efficient video selection process provides several videos, which are selected from a video database, to the user in order to manually label these videos as positive or negative. These labeled videos are used to update (i.e., fine-tune) the GAF space, so that the positive and negative videos move closer to and farther away from the query videos through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive experimental results on two team sports datasets validate that our method significantly improves the retrieval performance. Ablation studies also demonstrate that several components in our human-in-the-loop adaptation contribute to the improvement of the retrieval performance.

However, their effectiveness drops sharply when certain modalities are unavailable or incomplete. Current research primarily faces two dilemmas: Prompt-based methods struggle to restore missing yet indispensable features and impair generalization of VLMs. Imputation-based approaches, lacking effective guidance, are prone to generating semantically irrelevant noise. Restoring precise semantics while sustaining VLM generalization remains challenging. Therefore, we propose a general missing modality restoration strategy in this paper. We introduce an enhanced diffusion model as a pluggable mid-stage training module to effectively restore missing features. Our strategy introduces two key innovations: (I) Dynamic Modality Gating, which adaptively leverages conditional features to steer the generation of semantically consistent features; (II) Cross-Modal Mutual Learning mechanism, which bridges the semantic spaces of dual encoders to achieve bidirectional alignment. Zero-shot evaluations across benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods.

Value-based approaches offer a more principled path, yet three gaps persist: extraction often ignores hierarchical structure, evaluation detects presence but not calibrated intensity, and the steerability of LLMs at controlled intensities remains insufficiently understood. To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control. The framework integrates three components: (i) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space that captures intra- and cross-theory value structure; (ii) the Value Intensity DataBase (VIDB), a large-scale resource of value-labeled texts with intensity estimates derived from ranking-based aggregation; and (iii) an anchor-based evaluator that produces consistent intensity scores for model outputs by ranking them against VIDB panels. Using VALUEFLOW, we conduct a comprehensive large-scale study across ten models and four value theories, identifying asymmetries in steerability and composition laws for multi-value control.

Nevertheless, the substantial model size and high computational cost of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) limit downstream applications. While low-bit quantization is a common approach for model compression, the effectiveness of quantized models is challenged by the high dynamic range of input latent and diverse layer behaviors. To deal with these challenges, we introduce LSGQuant, a layer-sensitivity guided quantizing approach for one-step diffusion-based real-world VSR. Our method incorporates a Dynamic Range Adaptive Quantizer (DRAQ) to fit video token activations. Furthermore, we estimate layer sensitivity and implement a Variance-Oriented Layer Training Strategy (VOLTS) by analyzing layer-wise statistics in calibration. We also introduce Quantization-Aware Optimization (QAO) to jointly refine the quantized branch and a retained high-precision branch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has nearly performance to origin model with full-precision and significantly exceeds existing quantization techniques.

Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency.

However, existing regression-based approaches are prone to dynamic or ambiguous scenarios, as they either solely rely on single-frame inference or neglect the spatio-temporal consistency across scans. In this paper, we propose TempLoc, a new LiDAR relocalization framework that enhances the robustness of localization by effectively modeling sequential consistency. Specifically, a Global Coordinate Estimation module is first introduced to predict point-wise global coordinates and associated uncertainties for each LiDAR scan. A Prior Coordinate Generation module is then presented to estimate inter-frame point correspondences by the attention mechanism. Lastly, an Uncertainty-Guided Coordinate Fusion module is deployed to integrate both predictions of point correspondence in an end-to-end fashion, yielding a more temporally consistent and accurate global 6-DoF pose.

To address this issue, we propose TAME, a dual-memory evolutionary framework that separately evolves executor memory to improve task performance by distilling generalizable methodologies, and evaluator memory to refine assessments of both safety and task utility based on historical feedback. Through a closed loop of memory filtering, draft generation, trustworthy refinement, execution, and dual-track memory updating, TAME preserves trustworthiness without sacrificing utility.

In this paper, we introduce Accordion-Thinking, an end-to-end framework where LLMs learn to self-regulate the granularity of the reasoning steps through dynamic summarization. This mechanism enables a Fold inference mode, where the model periodically summarizes its thought process and discards former thoughts to reduce dependency on historical tokens. We apply reinforcement learning to incentivize this capability further, uncovering a critical insight: the accuracy gap between the highly efficient Fold mode and the exhaustive Unfold mode progressively narrows and eventually vanishes over the course of training. This phenomenon demonstrates that the model learns to encode essential reasoning information into compact summaries, achieving effective compression of the reasoning context. Our Accordion-Thinker demonstrates that with learned self-compression, LLMs can tackle complex reasoning tasks with minimal dependency token overhead without compromising solution quality, and it achieves a 3x throughput while maintaining accuracy on a 48GB GPU memory configuration, while the structured step summaries provide a human-readable account of the reasoning process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAccordion-Thinking\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6458\u8981\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u63a8\u7406\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08Chain-of-Thought\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8eKV\u7f13\u5b58\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Accordion-Thinking\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u6458\u8981\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u6298\u53e0\u201d\uff08Fold\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6298\u53e0\u4e0e\u5c55\u5f00\uff08Unfold\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u7f29\u5c0f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4f1a\u5c06\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u8fdb\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u572848GB GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b03\u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u538b\u7f29\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u5386\u53f2token\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u5b8c\u6210\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6458\u8981\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002"}}

Although world models provide a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving data, they often suffer from identity drift, where the same object changes its appearance or category across frames due to the absence of instance-level temporal constraints. We introduce ConsisDrive, an identity-preserving driving world model designed to enforce temporal consistency at the instance level. Our framework incorporates two key components: (1) Instance-Masked Attention, which applies instance identity masks and trajectory masks within attention blocks to ensure that visual tokens interact only with their corresponding instance features across spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby preserving object identity consistency; and (2) Instance-Masked Loss, which adaptively emphasizes foreground regions with probabilistic instance masking, reducing background noise while maintaining overall scene fidelity. By integrating these mechanisms, ConsisDrive achieves state-of-the-art driving video generation quality and demonstrates significant improvements in downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset.

However, high-performance trackers often suffer from slow processing speeds, making them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To alleviate this issue, we propose FARTrack, a Fast Auto-Regressive Tracking framework. Since autoregression emphasizes the temporal nature of the trajectory sequence, it can maintain high performance while achieving efficient execution across various devices. FARTrack introduces Task-Specific Self-Distillation and Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification, designed from the perspectives of shallow-yet-accurate distillation and redundant-to-essential token optimization, respectively. Task-Specific Self-Distillation achieves model compression by distilling task-specific tokens layer by layer, enhancing the model's inference speed while avoiding suboptimal manual teacher-student layer pairs assignments.

Each instance is constructed to require integrated image-text interpretation, and we additionally provide paired text-only controls to diagnose modality-induced behavior shifts. We evaluate 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs and observe systematic cross-modal alignment gaps. Models show weak safety awareness, strong language dominance under interference, and consistent performance degradation from text-only controls to multimodal inputs. We also observe a clear trade-off between reducing over-rejection and maintaining safe, non-discriminatory behavior, suggesting that some apparent safety gains may come from refusal-oriented heuristics rather than robust intent understanding.

Current synthesis paradigms often face a recurring trade-off: maintaining structural validity typically restricts problem complexity, while relaxing constraints to increase difficulty frequently leads to inconsistent or unsolvable instances. To address this, we propose Agentic Proposing, a framework that models problem synthesis as a goal-driven sequential decision process where a specialized agent dynamically selects and composes modular reasoning skills. Through an iterative workflow of internal reflection and tool-use, we develop the Agentic-Proposer-4B using Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization (MGPO) to generate high-precision, verifiable training trajectories across mathematics, coding, and science. Empirical results demonstrate that downstream solvers trained on agent-synthesized data significantly outperform leading baselines and exhibit robust cross-domain generalization. Notably, a 30B solver trained on only 11,000 synthesized trajectories achieves a state-of-the-art 91.6% accuracy on AIME25, rivaling frontier-scale proprietary models such as GPT-5 and proving that a small volume of high-quality synthetic signals can effectively substitute for massive human-curated datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAgentic Proposing\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u7f16\u7a0b\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728AIME25\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523091.6%\u7684SOTA\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5408\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5177\u5907\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08MGPO\uff09\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u5185\u7701\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6784\u5efaAgentic-Proposer-4B\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4ec5\u752811,000\u6761\u5408\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u768430B\u6a21\u578b\u5728AIME25\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523091.6%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c11\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

When adapted to vision transformers, the standard axial formulation decomposes two-dimensional spatial positions into horizontal and vertical components, implicitly restricting positional encoding to axis-aligned directions. We identify this directional constraint as a fundamental limitation of the standard axial 2D RoPE, which hinders the modeling of oblique spatial relationships that naturally exist in natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spiral RoPE, a simple yet effective extension that enables multi-directional positional encoding by partitioning embedding channels into multiple groups associated with uniformly distributed directions. Each group is rotated according to the projection of the patch position onto its corresponding direction, allowing spatial relationships to be encoded beyond the horizontal and vertical axes.

In this paper, we propose EventFlash, a novel and efficient MLLM to explore spatiotemporal token sparsification for reducing data redundancy and accelerating inference. Technically, we build EventMind, a large-scale and scene-diverse dataset with over 500k instruction sets, providing both short and long event stream sequences to support our curriculum training strategy. We then present an adaptive temporal window aggregation module for efficient temporal sampling, which adaptively compresses temporal tokens while retaining key temporal cues. Finally, a sparse density-guided attention module is designed to improve spatial token efficiency by selecting informative regions and suppressing empty or sparse areas. Experimental results show that EventFlash achieves a $12.4\\times$ throughput improvement over the baseline (EventFlash-Zero) while maintaining comparable performance. It supports long-range event stream processing with up to 1,000 bins, significantly outperforming the 5-bin limit of EventGPT.

While world models offer a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving videos, they struggle to maintain instance-level temporal consistency and spatial geometric fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose InstaDrive, a novel framework that enhances driving video realism through two key advancements: (1) Instance Flow Guider, which extracts and propagates instance features across frames to enforce temporal consistency, preserving instance identity over time. (2) Spatial Geometric Aligner, which improves spatial reasoning, ensures precise instance positioning, and explicitly models occlusion hierarchies. By incorporating these instance-aware mechanisms, InstaDrive achieves state-of-the-art video generation quality and enhances downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset. Additionally, we utilize CARLA's autopilot to procedurally and stochastically simulate rare but safety-critical driving scenarios across diverse maps and regions, enabling rigorous safety evaluation for autonomous systems.

Abstraction is essential for scaling agent memory, yet it often comes at the cost of specificity, obscuring the fine-grained details required for effective reasoning. We introduce Memora, a harmonic memory representation that structurally balances abstraction and specificity. Memora organizes information via its primary abstractions that index concrete memory values and consolidate related updates into unified memory entries, while cue anchors expand retrieval access across diverse aspects of the memory and connect related memories.

Theoretically, we show that standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graph (KG)-based memory systems emerge as special cases of our framework.

Furthermore, standard systems cannot perform \"blind\" localization from verbal descriptions alone, a capability needed for applications such as emergency response. To address these challenges, we introduce LaVPR, a large-scale benchmark that extends existing VPR datasets with over 650,000 rich natural-language descriptions. Using LaVPR, we investigate two paradigms: Multi-Modal Fusion for enhanced robustness and Cross-Modal Retrieval for language-based localization. Our results show that language descriptions yield consistent gains in visually degraded conditions, with the most significant impact on smaller backbones. Notably, adding language allows compact models to rival the performance of much larger vision-only architectures. For cross-modal retrieval, we establish a baseline using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Multi-Similarity loss, which substantially outperforms standard contrastive methods across vision-language models. Ultimately, LaVPR enables a new class of localization systems that are both resilient to real-world stochasticity and practical for resource-constrained deployment.

Among existing TTA strategies, pseudo-label-based methods have shown promising performance. However, they often rely on perturbation-ensemble heuristics (e.g., dropout sampling, test-time augmentation, Gaussian noise), which lack distributional grounding and yield unstable training signals. This can trigger error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. To address this, we propose \\textbf{A3-TTA}, a TTA framework that constructs reliable pseudo-labels through anchor-guided supervision. Specifically, we identify well-predicted target domain images using a class compact density metric, under the assumption that confident predictions imply distributional proximity to the source domain. These anchors serve as stable references to guide pseudo-label generation, which is further regularized via semantic consistency and boundary-aware entropy minimization. Additionally, we introduce a self-adaptive exponential moving average strategy to mitigate label noise and stabilize model update during adaptation. Evaluated on both multi-domain medical images (heart structure and prostate segmentation) and natural images, A3-TTA significantly improves average Dice scores by 10.40 to 17.68 percentage points compared to the source model, outperforming several state-of-the-art TTA methods under different segmentation model architectures. A3-TTA also excels in continual TTA, maintaining high performance across sequential target domains with strong anti-forgetting ability.

Existing defenses predominantly rely on safety fine-tuning or aggressive token manipulations, incurring substantial training costs or significantly degrading utility. Recent research shows that LLMs inherently recognize unsafe content in text, and the incorporation of visual inputs in VLMs frequently dilutes risk-related signals. Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning. Extensive experiments across multiple jailbreak and utility benchmarks demonstrate that RAI substantially reduces attack success rate without compromising task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6RAI\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9VLM\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b89\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7684token\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6216\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\uff1b\u4e14VLM\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u540e\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u539f\u672cLLM\u5177\u5907\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5185\u5bb9\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "RAI\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u201c\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u539f\u578b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u89c6\u89c9token\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u4f3cLLM\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u6548\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRAI\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u672a\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RAI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aVLM\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5176\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing preference-based conflict models rely exclusively on three qualitative relations, namely, preference, converse, and indifference, to describe agents' attitudes towards issue pairs, which significantly limits their capacity in capturing the essence of conflict. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situation that captures agents' attitudes towards issue pairs with finer granularity than that afforded by classical preference-based models. Afterwards, we develop intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict measures within this framework, and construct three-way conflict analysis models for trisecting the set of agent pairs, the agent set, and the issue set. Additionally, relative loss functions built on the proposed conflict functions are employed to calculate thresholds for three-way conflict analysis. Finally, we present adjustment mechanism-based feasible strategies that simultaneously account for both adjustment magnitudes and conflict degrees, together with an algorithm for constructing such feasible strategies, and provide an illustrative example to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u89c9\u6a21\u7cca\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e09\u652f\u51b2\u7a81\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u523b\u753b\u4e3b\u4f53\u5bf9\u8bae\u9898\u5bf9\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u4e09\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u53ef\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u504f\u597d\u3001\u9006\u504f\u597d\u548c\u65e0\u5dee\u5f02\u4e09\u79cd\u5b9a\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u523b\u753b\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u76f4\u89c9\u6a21\u7cca\u504f\u597d\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3b\u4f53\u5bf9\u8bae\u9898\u5bf9\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5b9a\u4e49\u76f4\u89c9\u6a21\u7cca\u504f\u597d\u51b2\u7a81\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u4e3b\u4f53\u5bf9\u3001\u4e3b\u4f53\u96c6\u548c\u8bae\u9898\u96c6\u7684\u4e09\u652f\u5212\u5206\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u51b2\u7a81\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e09\u5206\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u517c\u987e\u8c03\u6574\u5e45\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51b2\u7a81\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u5730\u523b\u753b\u51b2\u7a81\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e3b\u4f53\u4e0e\u8bae\u9898\u7684\u4e09\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u793a\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f4\u89c9\u6a21\u7cca\u504f\u597d\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u4e09\u652f\u51b2\u7a81\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u51b2\u7a81\u60c5\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

FOCUS sequentially performs image quality assessment with EfficientNetV2-S, followed by abnormality detection and multi-disease classification using a fine-tuned Vision Foundation Model. Crucially, FOCUS leverages a unified adaptive aggregation method to intelligently integrate 2D slices-level predictions into comprehensive 3D patient-level diagnosis. Trained and tested on 3,300 patients (40,672 slices), and externally validated on 1,345 patients (18,498 slices) across four different-tier centers and diverse OCT devices, FOCUS achieved high F1 scores for quality assessment (99.01%), abnormally detection (97.46%), and patient-level diagnosis (94.39%). Real-world validation across centers also showed stable performance (F1: 90.22%-95.24%). In human-machine comparisons, FOCUS matched expert performance in abnormality detection (F1: 95.47% vs 90.91%) and multi-disease diagnosis (F1: 93.49% vs 91.35%), while demonstrating better efficiency.

However, users are often ambiguous because they have not yet formed their intents: they must observe and explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking \"what kind of tone do you want?\" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize. Resulting models learn to collaborate with users by adaptively diverging (i.e., explore options) when intents are unclear, and converging (i.e., refine and implement) when intents concretize.

At the same time, in practical applications, generative data augmentation can be vulnerable to clean-label backdoor attacks, which aim to bypass human inspection. However, based on theoretical analysis and preliminary experiments, we observe that directly applying existing pixel-level clean-label backdoor attack methods (e.g., COMBAT) to generated images results in low attack success rates. This motivates us to move beyond pixel-level triggers and focus instead on the latent feature level. To this end, we propose InvLBA, an invisible clean-label backdoor attack method for generative data augmentation by latent perturbation. We theoretically prove that the generalization of the clean accuracy and attack success rates of InvLBA can be guaranteed. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our method improves the attack success rate by 46.43% on average, with almost no reduction in clean accuracy and high robustness against SOTA defense methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u5e72\u51c0\u6807\u7b7e\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5InvLBA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u9762\u6ce8\u5165\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u6807\u7b7e\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982COMBAT\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u65bd\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInvLBA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u6270\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cInvLBA\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u738746.43%\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u5e72\u51c0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u9762\u8bbe\u8ba1\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\uff0cInvLBA\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Thus, Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a promising pathway for deploying VLA models in lifelong robotic scenarios, yet balancing stability (retaining old skills) and plasticity (learning new ones) remains a formidable challenge for existing methods. We introduce CRL-VLA, a framework for continual post-training of VLA models with rigorous theoretical bounds. We derive a unified performance bound linking the stability-plasticity trade-off to goal-conditioned advantage magnitude, scaled by policy divergence. CRL-VLA resolves this dilemma via asymmetric regulation: constraining advantage magnitudes on prior tasks while enabling controlled growth on new tasks. This is realized through a simple but effective dual-critic architecture with novel Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF), where a frozen critic anchors semantic consistency and a trainable estimator drives adaptation.

Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, these approaches often rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision during training, which hinders their ability to fully exploit the dynamic potential of interactive tools and leads to redundant actions. To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, a framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as a multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce a hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with a clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency. Extensive experiments across 6 medical modalities and 21 datasets demonstrate that MedSAM-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively unifying autonomous medical reasoning with robust, iterative optimization.

Current defensive approaches remain cumbersome, often requiring invasive model modifications, expensive training procedures or auxiliary data access. To address these threats, in this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and non-invasive defense mechanism in the spectral domain, grounded in a theoretical and empirical analysis of the relationship between imperceptible perturbations and high-frequency spectral components. Building upon these insights, we introduce a novel purification framework, termed PWAVEP, which begins by computing a spectral graph wavelet domain saliency score and local sparsity score for each point. Guided by these values, PWAVEP adopts a hierarchical strategy, it eliminates the most salient points, which are identified as hardly recoverable adversarial outliers. Simultaneously, it applies a spectral filtering process to a broader set of moderately salient points. This process leverages a graph wavelet transform to attenuate high-frequency coefficients associated with the targeted points, thereby effectively suppressing adversarial noise. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed PWAVEP achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D point cloud purification.

CompTok uses a token-conditioned diffusion decoder. By employing an InfoGAN-style objective, where we train a recognition model to predict the tokens used to condition the diffusion decoder using the decoded images, we enforce the decoder to not ignore any of the tokens. To promote compositional control, besides the original images, CompTok also trains on tokens formed by swapping token subsets between images, enabling more compositional control of the token over the decoder. As the swapped tokens between images do not have ground truth image targets, we apply a manifold constraint via an adversarial flow regularizer to keep unpaired swap generations on the natural-image distribution. The resulting tokenizer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on image class-conditioned generation, but also demonstrates properties such as swapping tokens between images to achieve high level semantic editing of an image. Additionally, we propose two metrics that measures the landscape of the token space that can be useful to describe not only the compositionality of the tokens, but also how easy to learn the landscape is for a generator to be trained on this space. We show in experiments that CompTok can improve on both of the metrics as well as supporting state-of-the-art generators for class conditioned generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCompTok\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9tokenizer\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7token\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3001InfoGAN\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6d41\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9tokenizer\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u5907\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7684token\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "CompTok\u91c7\u7528token\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165InfoGAN\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5229\u7528\u6240\u6709\u8f93\u5165token\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u50cf\u95f4\u4ea4\u6362\u90e8\u5206token\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u4ea4\u6362token\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6d41\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30token\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u3002", "result": "CompTok\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7token\u4ea4\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u6307\u6807\u8868\u660e\u5176token\u7a7a\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u6613\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "CompTok\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9tokenizer\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\u548ctoken\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, across both unimodal and multimodal settings, we uncover a pervasive yet underexplored failure mode in existing routers: as the user's cost budget increases, routers systematically default to the most capable and most expensive model even when cheaper models already suffice. As a result, current routers under-utilize small models, wasting computation and monetary cost and undermining the core promise of routing; we term this phenomenon routing collapse. We attribute routing collapse to an objective--decision mismatch: many routers are trained to predict scalar performance scores, whereas routing decisions ultimately depend on discrete comparisons among candidate models. Consequently, small prediction errors can flip relative orderings and trigger suboptimal selections. To bridge this gap, we propose EquiRouter, a decision-aware router that directly learns model rankings, restoring the role of smaller models and mitigating routing collapse. On RouterBench, EquiRouter reduces cost by about 17\\% at GPT-4-level performance compared to the strongest prior router.

Eisenmann", "Julian Garcia", "Iyad Rahwan"], "title": "Group Selection as a Safeguard Against AI Substitution", "comment": "19 pages, 7 Figures", "summary": "Reliance on generative AI can reduce cultural variance and diversity, especially in creative work. This reduction in variance has already led to problems in model performance, including model collapse and hallucination. In this paper, we examine the long-term consequences of AI use for human cultural evolution and the conditions under which widespread AI use may lead to \"cultural collapse\", a process in which reliance on AI-generated content reduces human variation and innovation and slows cumulative cultural evolution. Using an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory, we compare two types of AI use: complement and substitute. AI-complement users seek suggestions and guidance while remaining the main producers of the final output, whereas AI-substitute users provide minimal input, and rely on AI to produce most of the output. We then study how these use strategies compete and spread under evolutionary dynamics. We find that AI-substitute users prevail under individual-level selection despite the stronger reduction in cultural variance. By contrast, AI-complement users can benefit their groups by maintaining the variance needed for exploration, and can therefore be favored under cultural group selection when group boundaries are strong.

Recent work in Generative Agent-Based Modeling has shown that large language models can simulate human-like synthetic personas with high fidelity, accurately reproducing the beliefs and behaviors of specific individuals. However, most approaches require detailed data about target populations and often prioritize density matching (replicating what is most probable) rather than support coverage (spanning what is possible), leaving long-tail behaviors underexplored. We introduce Persona Generators, functions that can produce diverse synthetic populations tailored to arbitrary contexts. We apply an iterative improvement loop based on AlphaEvolve, using large language models as mutation operators to refine our Persona Generator code over hundreds of iterations. The optimization process produces lightweight Persona Generators that can automatically expand small descriptions into populations of diverse synthetic personas that maximize coverage of opinions and preferences along relevant diversity axes. We demonstrate that evolved generators substantially outperform existing baselines across six diversity metrics on held-out contexts, producing populations that span rare trait combinations difficult to achieve in standard LLM outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201cPersona Generators\u201d\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08AlphaEvolve\uff09\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u957f\u5c3e\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u83b7\u53d6\u5177\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u771f\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u6216\u5047\u8bbe\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u8be6\u5c3d\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u9891\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u652f\u6301\u8986\u76d6\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u201cPersona Generators\u201d\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u610f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5408\u6210\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eAlphaEvolve\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5f02\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u767e\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u4e0d\u65ad\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u83b7\u5f97\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u63cf\u8ff0\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u51fa\u5728\u5173\u952e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8986\u76d6\u5e7f\u6cdb\u89c2\u70b9\u548c\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4eba\u7fa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u7f55\u89c1\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "Persona Generators\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Recent large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on static medical reasoning tasks, raising the question of whether they can function as dynamic medical world models capable of simulating disease progression and treatment outcomes over time. In this work, we show that LLMs only incorporating medical knowledge struggle to maintain consistent patient states under sequential interventions, leading to error accumulation in long-horizon clinical simulation. To address this limitation, we introduce EHRWorld, a patient-centric medical world model trained under a causal sequential paradigm, together with EHRWorld-110K, a large-scale longitudinal clinical dataset derived from real-world electronic health records. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that EHRWorld significantly outperforms naive LLM-based baselines, achieving more stable long-horizon simulation, improved modeling of clinically sensitive events, and favorable reasoning efficiency, highlighting the necessity of training on causally grounded, temporally evolving clinical data for reliable and robust medical world modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEHRWorld\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u65f6\u5e8f\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533b\u7597\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7eb5\u5411\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6EHRWorld-110K\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u5468\u671f\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u867d\u5728\u9759\u6001\u533b\u7597\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u7ed3\u679c\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u671f\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faEHRWorld\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u65f6\u5e8f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u96c6EHRWorld-110K\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEHRWorld\u5728\u957f\u5468\u671f\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u62df\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u654f\u611f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5efa\u6a21\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u533b\u7597\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5355\u7eaf\u4f9d\u8d56\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684LLM\u96be\u4ee5\u80dc\u4efb\u52a8\u6001\u533b\u7597\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Although significant progress has been made in existing methods, their optimization rely solely on the supervision from voxel labels and face the challenge of voxel sparsity as a large portion of voxels in autonomous driving scenarios are empty, which limits both optimization efficiency and model performance. To address this issue, we propose a \\textit{Multi-Resolution Alignment (MRA)} approach to mitigate voxel sparsity in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, which exploits the scene and instance level alignment across multi-resolution 3D features as auxiliary supervision. Specifically, we first propose the Multi-resolution View Transformer module, which projects 2D image features into multi-resolution 3D features and aligns them at the scene level through fusing discriminative seed features. Furthermore, we design the Cubic Semantic Anisotropy module to identify the instance-level semantic significance of each voxel, accounting for the semantic differences of a specific voxel against its neighboring voxels within a cubic area. Finally, we devise a Critical Distribution Alignment module, which selects critical voxels as instance-level anchors with the guidance of cubic semantic anisotropy, and applies a circulated loss for auxiliary supervision on the critical feature distribution consistency across different resolutions.

Includes futher experiments, corrections and new appendix", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in code generation and general reasoning, yet their capacity for autonomous multi-stage planning in high-dimensional, physically constrained environments remains an open research question. This study investigates the limits of current AI agents by evaluating them against the 12th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12), a complex astrodynamics challenge requiring the design of a large-scale asteroid mining campaign. We adapt the MLE-Bench framework to the domain of orbital mechanics and deploy an AIDE-based agent architecture to autonomously generate and refine mission solutions. To assess performance beyond binary validity, we employ an \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" methodology, utilizing a rubric developed by domain experts to evaluate strategic viability across five structural categories. A comparative analysis of models, ranging from GPT-4-Turbo to reasoning-enhanced architectures like Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3, reveals a significant trend: the average strategic viability score has nearly doubled in the last two years (rising from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26). However, we identify a critical capability gap between strategy and execution. While advanced models demonstrate sophisticated conceptual understanding, correctly framing objective functions and mission architectures, they consistently fail at implementation due to physical unit inconsistencies, boundary condition errors, and inefficient debugging loops.

We propose SLIM-Diff, a compact joint diffusion model whose main contributions are (i) a single shared-bottleneck U-Net that enforces tight coupling between anatomy and lesion geometry from a 2-channel image+mask representation, and (ii) loss-geometry tuning via a tunable $L_p$ objective. As an internal baseline, we include the canonical DDPM-style objective ($\u03b5$-prediction with $L_2$ loss) and isolate the effect of prediction parameterization and $L_p$ geometry under a matched setup. Experiments show that $x_0$-prediction is consistently the strongest choice for joint synthesis, and that fractional sub-quadratic penalties ($L_{1.5}$) improve image fidelity while $L_2$ better preserves lesion mask morphology.

However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines. Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSearch-R2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Actor-Refiner\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5076\u7136\u731c\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faActor-Refiner\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff1aActor\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0cMeta-Refiner\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u526a\u5207-\u518d\u751f\u201d\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fee\u590d\u9519\u8bef\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc1\u636e\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u53ca\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSearch-R2\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3aRAG\u548cRL\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Search-R2\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fee\u6b63\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u641c\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Through attention analysis, we identify conversational inertia, a phenomenon where models exhibit strong diagonal attention to previous responses, which is associated with imitation bias that constrains exploration. This reveals a tension when transforming few-shot LLMs into agents: longer context enriches environmental feedback for exploitation, yet also amplifies conversational inertia that undermines exploration. Our key insight is that for identical states, actions generated with longer contexts exhibit stronger inertia than those with shorter contexts, enabling construction of preference pairs without environment rewards. Based on this, we propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over highinertia ones. We further provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation.

However, their reliance on reconstruction-based training creates a fundamental conflict between the sharp, high-frequency attention maps of the encoder and the spatially consistent but blurry reconstruction maps of the decoder. We identify that this discrepancy gives rise to a vicious cycle: the noisy feature map from the encoder forces the decoder to average over possibilities and produce even blurrier outputs, while the gradient computed from blurry reconstruction maps lacks high-frequency details necessary to supervise encoder features. To break this cycle, we introduce Synergistic Representation Learning (SRL) that establishes a virtuous cycle where the encoder and decoder mutually refine one another. SRL leverages the encoder's sharpness to deblur the semantic boundary within the decoder output, while exploiting the decoder's spatial consistency to denoise the encoder's features. This mutual refinement process is stabilized by a warm-up phase with a slot regularization objective that initially allocates distinct entities per slot. By bridging the representational gap between the encoder and decoder, SRL achieves state-of-the-art results on video object-centric learning benchmarks.

Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors.

This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents. Our results provide principled guidelines for building efficient and robust MAS through diversity-aware design.

Existing approaches either passively adapt to available images or employ inefficient random exploration with filtering, decoupling generation from learning needs.

However, setting the token budget, as well as the threshold for adaptive reasoning, is a practical challenge that entails a fundamental risk-accuracy trade-off. We re-frame the budget setting problem as risk control, limiting the error rate while minimizing compute. Our framework introduces an upper threshold that stops reasoning when the model is confident (risking incorrect output) and a novel parametric lower threshold that preemptively stops unsolvable instances (risking premature stoppage). Given a target risk and a validation set, we use distribution-free risk control to optimally specify these stopping mechanisms. For scenarios with multiple budget controlling criteria, we incorporate an efficiency loss to select the most computationally efficient exiting mechanism.

However, they often introduce visual hallucinations like over-optimized details and semantic misalignment. This work preliminarily explores why visual hallucinations arise and how to reduce them. We first investigate RFT methods from a unified perspective, and reveal the core problems stemming from two aspects, exploration and exploitation: (1) limited exploration during stochastic differential equation (SDE) rollouts, leading to an over-emphasis on local details at the expense of global semantics, and (2) trajectory imitation process inherent in policy gradient methods, distorting the model's foundational vector field and its cross-step consistency. Building on this, we propose ConsistentRFT, a general framework to mitigate these hallucinations. Specifically, we design a Dynamic Granularity Rollout (DGR) mechanism to balance exploration between global semantics and local details by dynamically scheduling different noise sources. We then introduce a Consistent Policy Gradient Optimization (CPGO) that preserves the model's consistency by aligning the current policy with a more stable prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistentRFT significantly mitigates visual hallucinations, achieving average reductions of 49\\% for low-level and 38\\% for high-level perceptual hallucinations. Furthermore, ConsistentRFT outperforms other RFT methods on out-of-domain metrics, showing an improvement of 5.1\\% (v.s. the baseline's decrease of -0.4\\%) over FLUX1.dev.

However, existing methods often suffer from identity inconsistency and limited compositional control, as they rely on diffusion models to implicitly associate text prompts with reference images. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept-to-Appearance Guidance (CAG), a framework that provides explicit, structured supervision from high-level concepts to fine-grained appearances. At the conceptual level, we introduce a VAE dropout training strategy that randomly omits reference VAE features, encouraging the model to rely more on robust semantic signals from a Visual Language Model (VLM) and thereby promoting consistent concept-level generation in the absence of complete appearance cues.

We further introduce diagnostic evaluations that explicitly rule out textual shortcut solutions and verify whether VLMs truly leverage visual context.

However, task-irrelevant morphologies such as background clutter and sensor noise induce redundant activations (or anomalies). These anomalies expand activation ranges and skew activation distributions toward task-irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening the preservation of informative features. Without a clear criterion to distinguish anomalies, suppressing them can inadvertently discard useful information. To address this, we present InlierQ, an inlier-centric post-training quantization approach that separates anomalies from informative inliers. InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as an inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This design suppresses anomalies while preserving informative features. InlierQ is label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples.

Existing solutions often depend on expensive supervised training, reinforcement learning, or external tools, limiting efficiency and scalability. This work addresses a key question: how to adapt LVLMs to table reasoning with minimal annotation and no external tools?

While such paradigms have shown remarkable success in 2D, extending them to 3D remains largely underexplored. Existing attempts to unify 3D tasks under a single autoregressive (AR) paradigm lead to significant performance degradation due to forced signal quantization and prohibitive training cost. Our key insight is that the essential challenge lies not in enforcing a unified autoregressive paradigm, but in enabling effective information interaction between generation and understanding while minimally compromising their inherent capabilities and leveraging pretrained models to reduce training cost. Guided by this perspective, we present the first unified framework for 3D understanding and generation that combines autoregression with diffusion. Specifically, we adopt an autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm for 3D understanding, and a continuous diffusion paradigm for 3D generation. A lightweight transformer bridges the feature space of large language models and the conditional space of 3D diffusion models, enabling effective cross-modal information exchange while preserving the priors learned by standalone models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse 3D understanding and generation benchmarks, while also excelling in 3D editing tasks.

In this work, we propose Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (CDGS), a novel framework that formulates dynamic scene reconstruction as a budget-constrained optimization problem to enforce a strict, user-defined Gaussian budget during training. Our key insight is to introduce a differentiable budget controller as the core optimization driver. Guided by a multi-modal unified importance score, this controller fuses geometric, motion, and perceptual cues for precise capacity regulation. To maximize the utility of this fixed budget, we further decouple the optimization of static and dynamic elements, employing an adaptive allocation mechanism that dynamically distributes capacity based on motion complexity. Furthermore, we implement a three-phase training strategy to seamlessly integrate these constraints, ensuring precise adherence to the target count. Coupled with a dual-mode hybrid compression scheme, CDGS not only strictly adheres to hardware constraints (error < 2%}) but also pushes the Pareto frontier of rate-distortion performance.

Recently, deep learning (DL) based segmentation models have shown the capacity to accomplish such a task. However, the training of the segmentation networks requires large amount of data with manual annotations, which is a major concern due to the data scarcity from clinic. Working with limited data is still common for researches on novel imaging modalities. To enhance the effectiveness of DL models trained with limited data, data augmentation (DA) is a crucial regularization technique. Traditional DA (TDA) strategies focus on basic intra-image operations, i.e. generating images with different orientations and intensity distributions. In contrast, the interimage and object-level DA operations are able to create new images from separate individuals. However, such DA strategies are not well explored on the task of multi-organ segmentation. In this paper, we investigated four possible inter-image DA strategies: CutMix, CarveMix, ObjectAug and AnatoMix, on two organ segmentation datasets. The result shows that CutMix, CarveMix and AnatoMix can improve the average dice score by 4.9, 2.0 and 1.9, compared with the state-of-the-art nnUNet without DA strategies. These results can be further improved by adding TDA strategies. It is revealed in our experiments that Cut-Mix is a robust but simple DA strategy to drive up the segmentation performance for multi-organ segmentation, even when CutMix produces intuitively 'wrong' images. Our implementation is publicly available for future benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff08CutMix\u3001CarveMix\u3001ObjectAug \u548c AnatoMix\uff09\u5728\u591a\u5668\u5b98\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0 CutMix\u3001CarveMix \u548c AnatoMix \u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d CutMix \u8868\u73b0\u6700\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u5668\u5b98\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5668\u5b98\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u56db\u79cd\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff08CutMix\u3001CarveMix\u3001ObjectAug\u3001AnatoMix\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7684 nnUNet \u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff08TDA\uff09\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "CutMix\u3001CarveMix \u548c AnatoMix \u5206\u522b\u5c06\u5e73\u5747 Dice \u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u4e86 4.9\u30012.0 \u548c 1.9\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408 TDA \u540e\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u5373\u4f7f CutMix \u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u201c\u9519\u8bef\u201d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f CutMix\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u5668\u5b98\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\u4ee5\u4f9b\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

Building on these pairs, ELIQ adapts a pre-trained multimodal model into a quality-aware critic via instruction tuning and predicts two-dimensional quality using lightweight gated fusion and a Quality Query Transformer. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ELIQ consistently outperforms existing label-free methods, generalizes from AI-generated content (AIGC) to user-generated content (UGC) scenarios without modification, and paves the way for scalable and label-free quality assessment under continuously evolving generative models.

However, current Vid-LLMs struggle to simultaneously retain high-quality frame-level semantic information (i.e., a sufficient number of tokens per frame) and comprehensive video-level temporal information (i.e., an adequate number of sampled frames per video). This limitation hinders the advancement of Vid-LLMs towards fine-grained video understanding. To address this issue, we introduce the SlowFocus mechanism, which significantly enhances the equivalent sampling frequency without compromising the quality of frame-level visual tokens. SlowFocus begins by identifying the query-related temporal segment based on the posed question, then performs dense sampling on this segment to extract local high-frequency features. A multi-frequency mixing attention module is further leveraged to aggregate these local high-frequency details with global low-frequency contexts for enhanced temporal comprehension. Additionally, to tailor Vid-LLMs to this innovative mechanism, we introduce a set of training strategies aimed at bolstering both temporal grounding and detailed temporal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we establish FineAction-CGR, a benchmark specifically devised to assess the ability of Vid-LLMs to process fine-grained temporal understanding tasks.

Existing methods often struggle with topological fragmentation of slender creatures in the deep sea and the subtle feature extraction of transparent organisms. In this paper, we propose DeepTopo-Net, a novel framework that integrates topology-aware modeling with frequency-decoupled perception. To address physical degradation, we design the Water-Conditioned Adaptive Perceptor (WCAP), which employs Riemannian metric tensors to dynamically deform convolutional sampling fields. Furthermore, the Abyssal-Topology Refinement Module (ATRM) is developed to maintain the structural connectivity of spindly targets through skeletal priors. Specifically, we first introduce GBU-UCOD, the first high-resolution (2K) benchmark tailored for marine vertical zonation, filling the data gap for hadal and abyssal zones. Extensive experiments on MAS3K, RMAS, and our proposed GBU-UCOD datasets demonstrate that DeepTopo-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in preserving the morphological integrity of complex underwater patterns.

When target-domain normal data are unavailable, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) leverages vision-language models (VLMs). However, CLIP's coarse image-text alignment limits both localization and detection due to (i) spatial misalignment and (ii) weak sensitivity to fine-grained anomalies; prior work compensates with complex auxiliary modules yet largely overlooks the choice of backbone. We revisit the backbone and use TIPS-a VLM trained with spatially aware objectives. While TIPS alleviates CLIP's issues, it exposes a distributional gap between global and local features. We address this with decoupled prompts-fixed for image-level detection and learnable for pixel-level localization-and by injecting local evidence into the global score. Without CLIP-specific tricks, our TIPS-based pipeline improves image-level performance by 1.1-3.9% and pixel-level by 1.5-6.9% across seven industrial datasets, delivering strong generalization with a lean architecture.

Current methods mainly rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, this paradigm suffers from heavy data dependence and limited scalability against the rapid evolution of MLLMs. Although recent zero-shot approaches offer a flexible alternative, their performance remains significantly behind SFT-based methods, due to the straightforward workflow designs. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Refer-Agent}, a collaborative multi-agent system with alternating reasoning-reflection mechanisms. This system decomposes RVOS into step-by-step reasoning process. During reasoning, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine frame selection strategy to ensure the frame diversity and textual relevance, along with a Dynamic Focus Layout that adaptively adjusts the agent's visual focus. Furthermore, we propose a Chain-of-Reflection mechanism, which employs a Questioner-Responder pair to generate a self-reflection chain, enabling the system to verify intermediate results and generates feedback for next-round reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate that Refer-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including both SFT-based models and zero-shot approaches. Moreover, Refer-Agent is flexible and enables fast integration of new MLLMs without any additional fine-tuning costs.

JEPAs learn to predict in representation space rather than pixel space, avoiding the pitfalls of generative modeling while capturing semantically meaningful features suitable for downstream tasks. Our library provides modular, self-contained implementations that illustrate how representation learning techniques developed for image-level self-supervised learning can transfer to video, where temporal dynamics add complexity, and ultimately to action-conditioned world models, where the model must additionally learn to predict the effects of control inputs. Each example is designed for single-GPU training within a few hours, making energy-based self-supervised learning accessible for research and education. We provide ablations of JEA components on CIFAR-10. Probing these representations yields 91% accuracy, indicating that the model learns useful features. Extending to video, we include a multi-step prediction example on Moving MNIST that demonstrates how the same principles scale to temporal modeling. Finally, we show how these representations can drive action-conditioned world models, achieving a 97% planning success rate on the Two Rooms navigation task. Comprehensive ablations reveal the critical importance of each regularization component for preventing representation collapse.

However, this paradigm often suffers from severe visual redundancy and high computational overhead, especially when processing long videos. Crucially, existing keyframe selection strategies, especially those based on CLIP similarity, are prone to biases and may inadvertently overlook critical frames, resulting in suboptimal video comprehension. To address these significant challenges, we propose \\textbf{KTV}, a novel two-stage framework for efficient and effective training-free video understanding. In the first stage, KTV performs question-agnostic keyframe selection by clustering frame-level visual features, yielding a compact, diverse, and representative subset of frames that mitigates temporal redundancy. In the second stage, KTV applies key visual token selection, pruning redundant or less informative tokens from each selected keyframe based on token importance and redundancy, which significantly reduces the number of tokens fed into the LLM. Extensive experiments on the Multiple-Choice VideoQA task demonstrate that KTV outperforms state-of-the-art training-free baselines while using significantly fewer visual tokens, \\emph{e.g.}, only 504 visual tokens for a 60-min video with 10800 frames, achieving $44.8\\%$ accuracy on the MLVU-Test benchmark.

However, multimodal diagnosis in ophthalmic practice is typically challenged in terms of data heterogeneity, potential invasiveness, registration complexity, and so on. As such, a unified framework that integrates multimodal data synthesis and fusion is proposed for retinal disease classification and grading. Specifically, the synthesized multimodal data incorporates fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), multispectral imaging (MSI), and saliency maps that emphasize latent lesions as well as optic disc/cup regions. Parallel models are independently trained to learn modality-specific representations that capture cross-pathophysiological signatures. These features are then adaptively calibrated within and across modalities to perform information pruning and flexible integration according to downstream tasks. The proposed learning system is thoroughly interpreted through visualizations in both image and feature spaces. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrated the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art ones in the tasks of multi-label classification (F1-score: 0.683, AUC: 0.953) and diabetic retinopathy grading (Accuracy:0.842, Kappa: 0.861).

Computer graphics engines can generate synthetic images alongside their ground-truth annotations. However, models trained on such images can perform poorly on real images due to the domain gap between real and synthetic images. Style transfer methods can reduce this difference by applying a realistic style to synthetic images. Choosing effective data transformations and their sequence is difficult due to the large combinatorial search space of style transfer operators. Using multi-objective genetic algorithms, we optimize pipelines to balance structural coherence and style similarity to target domains. We study the use of paired-image metrics on individual image samples during evolution to enable rapid pipeline evaluation, as opposed to standard distributional metrics that require the generation of many images. After optimization, we evaluate the resulting Pareto front using distributional metrics and segmentation performance. We apply this approach to standard datasets in synthetic-to-real domain adaptation: from the video game GTA5 to real image datasets Cityscapes and ACDC, focusing on adverse conditions. Results demonstrate that evolutionary algorithms can propose diverse augmentation pipelines adapted to different objectives. The contribution of this work is the formulation of style transfer as a sequencing problem suitable for evolutionary optimization and the study of efficient metrics that enable feasible search in this space.

This is particularly crucial in the remote sensing domain, where the dense object distribution and a wide variety of categories contribute to prohibitively high costs. Based on the supervision level, existing oriented object detection algorithms can be broadly grouped into fully supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly supervised methods. Within the scope of this work, we further categorize them to include sparsely supervised and partially weakly-supervised methods. To address the challenges of large-scale labeling, we introduce the first Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection framework, designed to efficiently leverage only a few sparse weakly-labeled data and plenty of unlabeled data. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) We design a Sparse-annotation-Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (SOS-Student) model to separate unlabeled objects from the background in a sparsely-labeled setting, and learn orientation and scale information from orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations. (2) We construct a novel Multi-level Pseudo-label Filtering strategy that leverages the distribution of model predictions, which is informed by the model's multi-layer predictions. (3) We propose a unique sparse partitioning approach, ensuring equal treatment for each category. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and DIOR datasets show that our framework achieves a significant performance gain over traditional oriented object detection methods mentioned above, offering a highly cost-effective solution.

Prior works typically rely on binary or pairwise supervision, which often fail to capture the continuous and pluralistic nature of human moral reasoning. We present MM-SCALE (Multimodal Moral Scale), a large-scale dataset for aligning VLMs with human moral preferences through 5-point scalar ratings and explicit modality grounding. Each image-scenario pair is annotated with moral acceptability scores and grounded reasoning labels by humans using an interface we tailored for data collection, enabling listwise preference optimization over ranked scenario sets. By moving from discrete to scalar supervision, our framework provides richer alignment signals and finer calibration of multimodal moral reasoning.

Both suffer from the \"One Anomaly Class, One Model\" limitation. To address this, we propose Referring Industrial Anomaly Segmentation (RIAS), a paradigm leveraging language to guide detection. RIAS generates precise masks from text descriptions without manual thresholds and uses universal prompts to detect diverse anomalies with a single model. We introduce the MVTec-Ref dataset to support this, designed with diverse referring expressions and focusing on anomaly patterns, notably with 95% small anomalies. We also propose the Dual Query Token with Mask Group Transformer (DQFormer) benchmark, enhanced by Language-Gated Multi-Level Aggregation (LMA) to improve multi-scale segmentation. Unlike traditional methods using redundant queries, DQFormer employs only \"Anomaly\" and \"Background\" tokens for efficient visual-textual integration. Experiments demonstrate RIAS's effectiveness in advancing IAD toward open-set capabilities.

Although robotic platforms equipped with visual sensors can efficiently detect structural deficiencies, the automated generation of human-readable summaries from these detections remains a significant challenge, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper presents a novel two-stage pipeline for end-to-end summarization of underground deficiencies, combining our lightweight RAPID-SCAN segmentation model with a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) deployed on an edge computing platform. The first stage employs RAPID-SCAN (Resource-Aware Pipeline Inspection and Defect Segmentation using Compact Adaptive Network), achieving 0.834 F1-score with only 0.64M parameters for efficient defect segmentation. The second stage utilizes a fine-tuned Phi-3.5 VLM that generates concise, domain-specific summaries in natural language from the segmentation outputs. We introduce a curated dataset of inspection images with manually verified descriptions for VLM fine-tuning and evaluation. To enable real-time performance, we employ post-training quantization with hardware-specific optimization, achieving significant reductions in model size and inference latency without compromising summarization quality. We deploy and evaluate our complete pipeline on a mobile robotic platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world inspection scenarios. Our results show the potential of edge-deployable integrated AI systems to bridge the gap between automated defect detection and actionable insights for infrastructure maintenance, paving the way for more scalable and autonomous inspection solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5730\u4e0b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578bRAPID-SCAN\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bPhi-3.5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u867d\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u5730\u4e0b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u8bfb\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u5411\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ef4\u62a4\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u4ec5\u542b0.64M\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578bRAPID-SCAN\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u7f3a\u9677\u5206\u5272\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684Phi-3.5\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6458\u8981\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u63cf\u8ff0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8eVLM\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u786c\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "RAPID-SCAN\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u52300.834 F1\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u5b8c\u6574\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u79ef\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u96c6\u6210AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6548\u8fde\u63a5\u81ea\u52a8\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5730\u4e0b\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u5316\u5de1\u68c0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While effective over short horizons, these models often struggle with long-horizon generation, as small prediction errors accumulate over time. Prior methods alleviate this by introducing pre-trained teacher models and sequence-level distribution matching, which incur additional computational cost and fail to prevent error propagation beyond the training horizon. In this work, we propose LIVE, a Long-horizon Interactive Video world modEl that enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective, thereby eliminating the need for teacher-based distillation. Specifically, LIVE first performs a forward rollout from ground-truth frames and then applies a reverse generation process to reconstruct the initial state. The diffusion loss is subsequently computed on the reconstructed terminal state, providing an explicit constraint on long-horizon error propagation. Moreover, we provide an unified view that encompasses different approaches and introduce progressive training curriculum to stabilize training. Experiments demonstrate that LIVE achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-horizon benchmarks, generating stable, high-quality videos far beyond training rollout lengths.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLIVE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u63a7\u5236\u957f\u671f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u56e0\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u91ce\u5916\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "method": "LIVE\u91c7\u7528\u524d\u5411\u5c55\u5f00\u4e0e\u53cd\u5411\u91cd\u5efa\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u4ece\u524d\u5411\u771f\u5b9e\u5e27\u5f00\u59cb\u5c55\u5f00\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u751f\u6210\u91cd\u5efa\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7ec8\u6b62\u72b6\u6001\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u6563\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u957f\u671f\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLIVE\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u8fdc\u8d85\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684rollout\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "LIVE\u901a\u8fc7\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u6446\u8131\u4e86\u5bf9\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u91ce\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Current professional workflows require tedious manual segmentation and the artistic ``hallucination'' of occluded regions to enable motion. Our approach overcomes this by decomposing a single image into fully inpainted, semantically distinct layers with inferred drawing orders. To address the scarcity of training data, we introduce a scalable engine that bootstraps high-quality supervision from commercial Live2D models, capturing pixel-perfect semantics and hidden geometry. Our methodology couples a diffusion-based Body Part Consistency Module, which enforces global geometric coherence, with a pixel-level pseudo-depth inference mechanism. This combination resolves the intricate stratification of anime characters, e.g., interleaving hair strands, allowing for dynamic layer reconstruction.

We introduce Representation-Aligned Guidance (REPA-G), a framework that leverages these aligned representations, with rich semantic properties, to enable test-time conditioning from features in generation. By optimizing a similarity objective (the potential) at inference, we steer the denoising process toward a conditioned representation extracted from a pre-trained feature extractor. Our method provides versatile control at multiple scales, ranging from fine-grained texture matching via single patches to broad semantic guidance using global image feature tokens. We further extend this to multi-concept composition, allowing for the faithful combination of distinct concepts. REPA-G operates entirely at inference time, offering a flexible and precise alternative to often ambiguous text prompts or coarse class labels. We theoretically justify how this guidance enables sampling from the potential-induced tilted distribution. Quantitative results on ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality, diverse generations.

In addition, we provide object-level descriptions derived from the corresponding high-resolution sRGB images, facilitating the study of object-level information preservation under RAW image processing and low-bit quantization. The dataset allows evaluation under simulated 4-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit quantization, reflecting realistic sensor constraints, and provides a benchmark for studying detection performance, description quality & detail, and generalization in low-bit RAW image processing.

Alvarez", "Talia Konkle"], "title": "FOVI: A biologically-inspired foveated interface for deep vision models", "comment": null, "summary": "Human vision is foveated, with variable resolution peaking at the center of a large field of view; this reflects an efficient trade-off for active sensing, allowing eye-movements to bring different parts of the world into focus with other parts of the world in context. In contrast, most computer vision systems encode the visual world at a uniform resolution, raising challenges for processing full-field high-resolution images efficiently. We propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) based on the human retina and primary visual cortex, that reformats a variable-resolution retina-like sensor array into a uniformly dense, V1-like sensor manifold. Receptive fields are defined as k-nearest-neighborhoods (kNNs) on the sensor manifold, enabling kNN-convolution via a novel kernel mapping technique. We demonstrate two use cases: (1) an end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture, and (2) a foveated adaptation of the foundational DINOv3 ViT model, leveraging low-rank adaptation (LoRA). These models provide competitive performance at a fraction of the computational cost of non-foveated baselines, opening pathways for efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision.

Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup. This translates to a 22.6% performance improvement over the LLM-derived method SmoothQuant. Our work establishes a new, principled foundation for compressing VLA models in robotics, paving the way for deploying powerful, large-scale models on real-world hardware.

However, brain shift invalidates the preoperative MRI after dural opening. Updated intraoperative brain MRI with brain shift compensation is crucial for enhancing the precision of neuronavigation systems and ensuring the optimal outcome of surgical interventions. Methodology: We propose NeuralShift, a U-Net-based model that predicts brain shift entirely from pre-operative MRI for patients undergoing temporal lobe resection. We evaluated our results using Target Registration Errors (TREs) computed on anatomical landmarks located on the resection side and along the midline, and DICE scores comparing predicted intraoperative masks with masks derived from intraoperative MRI. Results: Our experimental results show that our model can predict the global deformation of the brain (DICE of 0.97) with accurate local displacements (achieve landmark TRE as low as 1.12 mm), compensating for large brain shifts during temporal lobe removal neurosurgery. Conclusion: Our proposed model is capable of predicting the global deformation of the brain during temporal lobe resection using only preoperative images, providing potential opportunities to the surgical team to increase safety and efficiency of neurosurgery and better outcomes to patients.

Some recent works have addressed this by conditioning between scales in a multiscale pyramid. Others have looked at parallelizing samples in a single image using regular partitions or randomized orders. In this work we examine a flexible, fixed ordering based on progressive checkerboards for multiscale autoregressive image generation. Our ordering draws samples in parallel from evenly spaced regions at each scale, maintaining full balance in all levels of a quadtree subdivision at each step.

Existing efforts in efficient training focus on reducing model sizes or trainable parameters. Inspired by the success of Visual Token Pruning (VTP) in improving inference efficiency, we are exploring another substantial research direction for efficient training by reducing visual tokens. However, applying VTP at the training stage results in a training-inference mismatch: pruning-trained models perform poorly when inferring on non-pruned full visual token sequences. To close this gap, we propose DualSpeed, a fast-slow framework for efficient training of MLLMs. The fast-mode is the primary mode, which incorporates existing VTP methods as plugins to reduce visual tokens, along with a mode isolator to isolate the model's behaviors. The slow-mode is the auxiliary mode, where the model is trained on full visual sequences to retain training-inference consistency. To boost its training, it further leverages self-distillation to learn from the sufficiently trained fast-mode. Together, DualSpeed can achieve both training efficiency and non-degraded performance. Experiments show DualSpeed accelerates the training of LLaVA-1.5 by 2.1$\\times$ and LLaVA-NeXT by 4.0$\\times$, retaining over 99% performance.

However, existing models lack a mechanism for smoothly controlling the intensity of text-guided edits. In standard text-conditioned generation, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) impacts prompt adherence, suggesting it as a potential control for edit intensity in editing models. However, we show that scaling CFG in these models does not produce a smooth transition between the input and the edited result. We attribute this behavior to the unconditional prediction, which serves as the guidance origin and dominates the generation at low guidance scales, while representing an arbitrary manipulation of the input content. To enable continuous control, we introduce Adaptive-Origin Guidance (AdaOr), a method that adjusts this standard guidance origin with an identity-conditioned adaptive origin, using an identity instruction corresponding to the identity manipulation. By interpolating this identity prediction with the standard unconditional prediction according to the edit strength, we ensure a continuous transition from the input to the edited result. We evaluate our method on image and video editing tasks, demonstrating that it provides smoother and more consistent control compared to current slider-based editing approaches. Our method incorporates an identity instruction into the standard training framework, enabling fine-grained control at inference time without per-edit procedure or reliance on specialized datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u539f\u70b9\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08AdaOr\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8eab\u4efd\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u539f\u70b9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7f16\u8f91\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e73\u6ed1\u63a7\u5236\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u81ea\u7531\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08CFG\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5f71\u54cd\u63d0\u793a\u9075\u5faa\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u7f29\u653eCFG\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u7f16\u8f91\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u5176\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u539f\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4e3b\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5374\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u539f\u70b9\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08AdaOr\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u6052\u7b49\u53d8\u6362\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u6307\u4ee4\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8eab\u4efd\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u539f\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u7f16\u8f91\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5c06\u6b64\u8eab\u4efd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u4fdd\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u7f16\u8f91\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ed1\u5757\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cAdaOr\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u5f3a\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaOr\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u8eab\u4efd\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u6b21\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6d41\u7a0b\u6216\u4e13\u95e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u5f3a\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

While there are recent works on event-based novel-view synthesis, dense 3D mesh reconstruction remains scarcely explored and existing event-based techniques are severely limited in their 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this limitation, we present EventNeuS, a self-supervised neural model for learning 3D representations from monocular colour event streams. Our approach, for the first time, combines 3D signed distance function and density field learning with event-based supervision. Furthermore, we introduce spherical harmonics encodings into our model for enhanced handling of view-dependent effects. EventNeuS outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin, achieving 34% lower Chamfer distance and 31% lower mean absolute error on average compared to the best previous method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EventNeuS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u5f69\u8272\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e603D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u57283D\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u5bc6\u96c63D\u7f51\u683c\u91cd\u5efa\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "EventNeuS\u7ed3\u5408\u4e863D\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u573a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u7403\u8c10\u51fd\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\u4f9d\u8d56\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "result": "EventNeuS\u5728Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u6b64\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8634%\u548c31%\u3002", "conclusion": "EventNeuS\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
